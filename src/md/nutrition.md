## Nutrition

### Principles
- Simpler is better
- Eat like your grandmother (don't eat anything she wouldn't recognize)
- Shop on the peripheries (fruits, veggies, milk, eggs)
- Prefer farmer markets over grocery stores
- Eat wild meats
  - Meat is not evil; in fact it is an excellent source of protein
- Eat whole grains and fruits (oats, brown rice)
- Reduce added sugar, saturated fats, and refined grains
- Eat vegetables; its okay to blend them
- Avoid junk food (fast food)

### Macro
- Aim for 1 g / lb of protein per day
  - You can only absorb 25-30g proten per meal so prioritize protein in each meal
- Don't overdo carbs when possible; aim for "brown carbs"
