## First Principles Learning

Elon’s mental model for learning quickly is the ‘Knowledge Tree.’The idea is to view knowledge as a tree so you can break it into bits.For example, ‘Trunks and big branches’ VS ‘Leaves and fruits’.

Trunk - old books, biographies, history, super texts. Teach you the principles and fundamentals. True timeless wisdom.
Fruits - new books, blogs, podcasts. Consume to look at things in a new way.
Leaves - news and noise.

> Knowledge is a semantic tree; you need to understand the fundamental principles. The trunk and big branches before you get to the leaves
