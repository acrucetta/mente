## Friendship

### First Stages

At the first stages of friendship, it's important to be available, to make time to hang out, without a purpose. 

Propose times to meet-up, build a connection 1 on 1. Unite over common interests.

Over time, we can let the schedules dictate more when to spend time together and it doesn't need to be as often if it's not possible. 

But the first stages are crucial, like a seedling in a garden we must nurture it and help it grow to a stable plant.

Many a times I've seen the impact of letting go of a friendship at the beginning, specially when you're moving to a new city. You decide to meet up, and then let the busyness of life separate each other until forgetfulness ensues.

### Types of friends

Aristotle, in his Nicomachean Ethics.[25] He argued that friendships can be classified along a kind of ladder. At the bottom rung—where people are least connected emotionally, so the commitment is weakest—are the deal friends based on utility to each other in work or social life. These are colleagues, partners to a transaction, or simply those who can do each other favors. Higher up are friendships based on pleasure—something you like and admire about the other person, such as their intelligence or sense of humor. At the highest level are friendships of virtue, or what Aristotle called “perfect friendship.” These friendships are an end in themselves, and not instrumental to anything else.
