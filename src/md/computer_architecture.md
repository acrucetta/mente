## Computer Architecture

All computers stem from the "stored program concept". The computer is based on a fixed hardware platform capable of executing a fixed set of instructions. They can be combined like building blocks to yield sophisticated programs.

The von Neumann architecture:
- Computers can hold both data and instructions in memory.
- We can compute the instructions with a CPU that contains registers, an ALU and a control unit

A typical architecture:
