## Notes on Deep Learning Systems 

## Week 1

### On Writing
- Use writing as you're learning to log your lessons
- Keep a learning journal where you explore ideas, ask questions, and experiment with concepts
- Write to discover and explain complex concepts to yourself
- Practice diff techniques: aha statements, quick writes, edit for clarity
- Connect ideas, ask questions and summarize key points

### Situational Awareness

We might be able to reach AGI by 2027. There have been dramatic changes in compute, algorithm efficiency, and scale of training clusters. 

GPTs have outperformed all predictions by experts now being able to perform at PhD level in many fields of knowledge. We can expect to continue these improvements over time.
