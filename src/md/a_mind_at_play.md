## Notes from a Mind at Play

Things to remember from the book:
- What is information theory?
- How was it defined?
- What was Bool's influence in Claude Shannon?
- How did Claude Shannon use logic theory as inspiration for information theory?
- What are bits as defined by Claude Shannon?
- Why did it take long for people to come up with information theory?
- Where was it used first? 
- What is the mathematical underpinning behind information theory?
