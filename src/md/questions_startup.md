## How to not get your offer rescinded from the start-up 

It's hard to know if a start-up will survive before joining. Many of them fail for different reasons. The big two are running out of money and shipping a product nobody wanted.

Since college, I've worked on a few start-ups and applied to a bunch more. Out of those applications, I got offers rescinded from two early stage start-ups. One in 2022, right after the end of the zero-interest rate company phenomenon. Another one in 2023, this time it was a clean-tech company that ran out of money.

I asked a few questions before joining these companies. But I think I could've done a better job. These are some areas I missed.

You want to make sure: 1) the company has enough money; 2) your role is in a growing business; 3) your role is valuable; and 4) venture capital firms backing the start-up have a good track record.

### 1. How much money do they have?

1. What's your burn rate? What will it be in 6 months? 
2. When was the last time you raised money, how much did you raise, and at what valuation?
3. When do you expect to become profitable?

### 2. Is the company growing?

1. How fast is your target market growing? Where do you stand in this market?
2. What has been the employee turnover rate over the past year? Have any key employees left recently, and if so, why?

### 3. Is the role important to the team?

1. What are you going to be doing? Is there an important vacuum you're filling? Or are you part of "growing a team"
2. Is your skillset important for the company's success? e.g., are you going to be first infrastructure engineer?

### 4. Is the company backed by reputable VC firms?

1. Who have they backed before?
2. What's their track record of successful exits?

Even if the companies hire you, they might have no idea of what they need. 

During an interview in 2022. I asked the CEO of the start-up whether they had enough money to run for a while. He said they did. Three days before joining the offer was rescinded. Turns out they had some money, but they still had to make cuts to survive.

After that, I changed my mind in how important the questions were. I still think you should ask these questions. But you might not get truthful answers, or they might not actually know. 

I think it's important to do your own research and find out how the company is doing. Regardless of what they tell you during interviews.

These are some useful sites.

1. **Crunchbase**: great information on latest funding rounds and founders
2. **LinkedIn Company Statistics:** you can see turnover rates and people who left or joined the company recently
3. **Industry News**: e.g., TechCrunch, VentureBeat, Business Insider, and Forbes
4. **Start-up ranking site:** https://www.joinprospect.com

At each of these sources, your goal should be to get a feel of how much "heat" there is around the company. That can be a) increasing number of customers, b) recent fundraising rounds c), and c) highlights in industry blogs.

Assuming you get enough green flags from your conversations and the industry is looking promising. You still have a decision to make.

This is more of a personal question, where are you at your career, and how much risk are you willing to take. 

In college I worked at a hardware seed-stage start-up. We didn't make any money, and it took us a while to ship a product, but we did it. I learned a lot, but it was very risky.

A few years after, I joined Series B start-ups (30-50 people, $50M~ raised). With more "experienced" leaders and money in the bank. It was still not structured, and I didn't have strong mentorship, but you get a lot of autonomy (if you know what you're doing, you better do, otherwise you're going to be at the mercy of outlandish product requirements and tight deadlines)

I think it can be exciting to join an earlier-stage start-up. But I would ensure you know what you're doing when you join. After spending enough times at early-stage companies I think having good mentorship is important if you're just getting into software engineering. 

Looking back, I would recommend anyone new to join a start-up between 50-100 people with 2-3 experienced engineers above you. I would also ensure the engineering leadership is technical and knows what they're doing. You don't want to fall into technical teams with a CTO that hasn't coded in 20 years. 

An added perk if the start-up is using tools that can make you marketable in future roles. If not, run in the other direction and ghost your recruiter.

Assuming the company meets all your needs, I would keep trying to learn outside of your job to stay sharp. The industry changes and what you like might change. To avoid pidgeon-holing yourself in a role, it's good to keep challenging yourself in outside projects and talking with other engineers outside of your company.  

Start-ups are risky by default. If you do join one, you will learn a lot and get more autonomy. If the one you join manages to survive, it can be a rewarding journey.
