- Are there principles in language design that make them be more useful?

### Algorithms
- What algorithms are used most often in Machine Learning problems?
- How did the work with algorithms influence the development of Neural Networks?

### Fitness

	- How can muscles become "stronger" without being "bigger"?

### Learning
- How does having an emotional connection with subjects help us learn faster?
