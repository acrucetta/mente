## Notes on Software Architecture

### Game Programming Patterns

Good architecture takes real
effort and discipline. Every time you make a change or implement a feature, you
have to work hard to integrate it gracefully into the rest of the program. You
have to take great care to both organize the code
well and keep it organized throughout the thousands of little changes that
make up a development cycle.

The second half of this — maintaining your design — deserves special
attention. I’ve seen many programs start out beautifully and then die a death of a
thousand cuts as programmers add “just one tiny little hack” over and over
again.

Like gardening, it’s not enough to put in new plants. You must also weed and
prune.

“Writing well-architected code takes careful thought, and that translates to
time. Moreso, maintaining a good architecture over the life of a project takes
a lot of effort. You have to treat your codebase like a good camper does their
campsite: always try to leave it a little better than you found it.”
