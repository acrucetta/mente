## Notes on Managing People

### On providing enough context

There are many aspects to delegating well, but one that I think is underrated is this: Taking the time upfront to explain a project thoughtfully.

Instead, many managers toss a request over the wall with zero context and say “do this.”

Here are five areas to cover:

1. Increase comprehension: Am I explaining in a way that’s easy to understand?
2. Increase buy-in: Am I getting the person excited?
3. Derisk: Am I addressing obvious risks?
4. Confirm alignment: Am I giving them a chance to speak up?
5. Feedback loop: Am I creating the shortest feedback loop possible?
