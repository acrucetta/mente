### The Bear (S2E7)

Ritchie: Yo. Garrett. Chef. I've been doing this forever. Can I... wash dishes or something?

Garrett: No, we got the best dishwashers in the world. You're just gonna slow 'em down. That wasn't clean.

R: I've been doing this for nine hours. I think I know what's clean.

G: I'm telling you, that's not clean. That was not clean either. Please do them properly--

R: Yo. They're goddamn forks.

G: Outside.

[they go outside]

G: Do you think this is below you or something?

R: Man, I think I'm 45 years old, polishing forks.

G: No one is asking you to be here. I don't think anybody remembers your name.

R: Nice try. You think I don't know how hard it is hiring people since COVID?

G: We don't have that problem.

R: You really drink this Kool-Aid, huh?

G: Yeah, I do.

R: Why?

G: Because I love this, Richie. I love this so much, dude. Did you know that when this restaurant opened 12 years ago, it won the best restaurant in the world the same year? It's retained three stars because we have a waiting list that's long. Five thousand people waiting at any given moment long. Do you see their faces when they walk in here? How stoked they are to see us and how stoked we have to be to serve them? It takes 200 people to keep this place in orbit. And at any given moment, one of those people that is waiting in line gets to eat here. They get to spend their time and their money here. I'm sorry, bro, but we need to have some forks without streaks in them. Every day here is the freaking Super Bowl. You don't have to drink the Kool-Aid, Richie. I just need you to respect me. I need you to respect the staff. I need you to respect the diners. And I need you to respect yourself.

R: I can do respect.

G: Lovely. I'll see you inside.
