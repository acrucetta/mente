## Notes on Attention Cottages

An attention cottage is a place where you can tune out the world and focus on your most important task. Whether it be art, writing, drawing, sketching, singing, even coding.

It is just you and your work. 

It can be a room in your house or a time of the day. A "blissful" station. Where no one can bother you. Whether it is early in the morning or late at night. In a corner in a coffee shop, or on the train with your phone on airplane mode.

We all need to cultivate this space. Otherwise our heads will become pingball machines at the mercy of the latest news, trends, or gossip.
