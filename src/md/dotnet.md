## Notes on .NET

It's a multi-platform way to run different programs. A single SDK, one BCL, unified toolchain.

It includes
  Languages - C#, F#
  Runtimes - Common Language Runtime (JVM)
  Libraries - BCL Functions

Nuget = NPM, Maven, etc...

DOTNET cli = CLI that allows you to build the projects.

To run programs: `dotnet run`, to build projects `dotnet new console`
