## Notes on Work

### Paul Graham (How to Do Great Work)

Formulas for meaningful work:
- Reading + People + Writing = New Ideas
- Trying + Time = Interests
- Interest + Hard Work + Luck = Results

Main Ideas:
- The way to figure out what to work on is by working. It's okay to guess wrong. In fact, it's better to know multiple things and make connections
- To know what to work on, you need to ask yourself what are you curious to a degree that would bore most other people
    - Once you find that thing, learn enough to get to the *frontiers of knowledge*
    - These frontiers of knowledge look abstract from afar; but once you learn enough about a subject you'll find many gaps in research; areas ripe for you to explore
    - The four steps are: choose a field, learn enough to get to the frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones
    - Interest will drive you to do something impressive
- Ambition can come before you learn something, or can come as you learn more about it
- If you don't know what to work on; take chance meetings, make yourself a big target for luck. Try lots of things, meet people, read books, ask questions
- A field should become increasingly interesting to you as you learn more about it
    - If you like areas that are deemed as tedious then its a good sign
- When working, you should do the things you'd want to consume, read, or use; don't write for a seemingly abstract audience
- Beware of pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politices, other people's wishes, and eminent frauds. Stick to what *you* find interesting
- The key recipe is: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects and something good will come out of it
    - Don't plan too much; naivete can be good, specially when you're younger
    - At each stage, do whatever seems more interesting and gives you options for the future
- Try to arrange your life so that you have contiguous blocks of time to work in; otherwise you can shy away from hard tasks
- Work has some activation energy; when you want to get started, do the least amount of work possible and let the compounding energy drive you. Its okay to lie to get you going
- **Try to finish what you start** ; even if it turns out to be more work than expected. The last bits of a project can include the best work
- Ask yourself: am I working on what I most want to work on? Ok if not when young, dangerous when older
- Great work happens by focusing consitently on something you're interested in
    - It compounds over time
    - You can learn more easily as you learn more about a subject
- Cultivate your taste in work done in your field.
    - What makes great work? What makes it so?
    - **This is what you're aiming for**
- **If you don't try to be the best, you won't even be good**
    - Errors in ambition happen in one direction - miss by falling short
    - Being "good" can be too vague of a standard
    - It can be easier to be the best than only to be good
- Aim to do something people will care about in 100 years
    - If something still seems good it's worth doing
- Be earnest; avoid affectation
    - Affectation = pretending someone other than you is doing the work; adopting a fake persona
    - Earnestness = being intellectually honest, have a sharp eye for the truth; admit when you make a mistake
- Preserve the nerd 
    - Keep the innocent boldness from childhood
    - Put things out there instead of criticizing others
    - Be informal, spend little effort seeming anything other than what you are. Basically a nerd. 
- Originality isn't a process, but a habit of mind
    - Original ideas come from trying to build or understand something slightly too difficult
    - Writing about ideas helps you create a sort of vacuum that drives more ideas out of you
    - Changing your context can help; visiting new places or going for a walk
- Don't divide your attention too thinly; be professionaly curious about a few topics and idly curious about many more
