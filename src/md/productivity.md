## Compiled thoughts on productivity

"Small compounds in productivity can have a large impact in your long-term career"

### Sam Altman

If you're not feeling productive:
- Your task might not be clear
- Your project might not be defined
- You might not want to work on it
- It might not be connected to your values (or you don't see the clear connection)

One of the most important beliefs is that you can learn whatever you want; and that you can improve quickly.

Three key pillars:
- Make sure to get the important shit done
- Dont waste time on stupid shit
- Make lots of lists

Most meetings should be 15-20 min or 2 hours.

Don't fall in productivity porn, it's more important to work on the right things than to work efficiently on the wrong things. Focus on the year not the day.

Have great sleep: quiet, dark, cold room.

Invest in good monitors, beautiful desk.

Don't neglet friends and family for the sake of productivity. Stupid trade-off.

Think more about what to work on.
