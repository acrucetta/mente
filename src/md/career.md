## Notes on Careers

### From the 40 year career (Irrational Excuberence blog)

- Don't think of your career as stints from IPO to IPO
- Focus on growth and engagement over time; measure your career in decades
- Focus on a small handfun of things that compound over time
    - Pace
        - Pace yourself, don't burn out
        - How long of a vacation does it take to not feel anxious about coming back
    - People
        - Are you building your network? If not work at a larger company for a few years
        - They will be there for you throughout your life; become referrals, new opportunities, etc...
        - Approach each new role with the intention of building a network of folks you know and work with well
    - Prestige
        - Prestige can be a lubricant
        - You can manufacture prestige by producing great work, blogging, sharing your projects
        - Leverage your success in a role to a role thats a bit bigger
        - Deliberately sharing in your blog, writing for others, publishing books
        - Prestige can be the result of deliberate, intentional action over time
    - Profit
        - The best roles can be only accessible if you're already financially stable; that is you can interview, take your time talking with companies
        - For some people it can take 10 months
        - The key is not getting rich but creating flexibility for yourself
    - Learning
        - Spend 4 hours a week thinking about the future, then let that thinking compound over time
        - Each year set personal and professional goals; you can learn deep or learn broad. You need ample space for both
        - Each year identify two new things that you're uncomfortable with and do them
        - Do enough to maintain your habit of learninng
        - Learning doesn't only come from doing new things, it comes from reflecting on the things you do. You need space to reflect
