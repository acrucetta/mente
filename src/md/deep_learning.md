Unlike statistics, machine learning deals with large and complex datasets. It is fundamentally an engineering discipline. Unlike theoretical physics or mathematics it is a very hands on field driven by empirical findings and deeply reliant on advances in software and hardware.

The central problem is how can we meaningfully transform data, in other words, learn useful representations of the input at hand to get us closer to the expected output.
