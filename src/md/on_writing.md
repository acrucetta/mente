# Notes on Writing


## Paul Graham

How to write clearly
- Use simple words; easier words means people focus on the ideas and not on the prose
- When you write in a fancy way you make readers do extra work
- Writing simply exposes ideas for what they are
- When you write sentences with fancy words it can be offensive and clumsy
- Write the first draft then spend time editing it. Cutting.

How to write usefully
- Importance + Novelty + Correctness + Strength
- Its OK to use "I think" to classify the certainty of your ideas. It also makes you sound less pretentious.
- Use writing as a tool to think
- Loose then tight. Write the first draft fast trying out many ideas; then rewrite carefully
- Make something you want. The reader is not completely unlike you
- To get novelty, write about things you've thought a lot. Anything that surprises you. 
    - If you don't learn anything from an essay don't publish it
- To start writing, lexas the importance. The number of people who care about what you write.
- Write something so narrow you might be an expert in it
- Another constraint to relax. You don't need to publish everything
