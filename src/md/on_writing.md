# Notes on Writing


## Paul Graham

Put ideas into words
- Half the ideas that end up in an essay, will be the ones you thought while writing them
- If writing down your ideas albways makes them more precise and more complete, then no one who hasn't written about a topic has fully formed ideas about it. And someone who never writes has no fully formed ideas about anything nontrivial.


Writing, briefly
- If you can't get started, tell someone what you plan to write about, then write down what you said; expect 80% of the ideas in an essay to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong;
- don't (always) make detailed outlines; mull ideas over for a few days before writing; carry a small notebook or scrap paper with you; start writing when you think of the first sentence
- when you restart, begin by rereading what you have so far; when you finish, leave yourself something easy to start with; accumulate notes for topics you plan to cover at the bottom of the file; don't feel obliged to cover any of them

How to write clearly
- Use simple words; easier words means people focus on the ideas and not on the prose
- When you write in a fancy way you make readers do extra work
- Writing simply exposes ideas for what they are
- When you write sentences with fancy words it can be offensive and clumsy
- Write the first draft then spend time editing it. Cutting.

How to write usefully
- Importance + Novelty + Correctness + Strength
- Its OK to use "I think" to classify the certainty of your ideas. It also makes you sound less pretentious.
- Use writing as a tool to think
- Loose then tight. Write the first draft fast trying out many ideas; then rewrite carefully
- Make something you want. The reader is not completely unlike you
- To get novelty, write about things you've thought a lot. Anything that surprises you. 
    - If you don't learn anything from an essay don't publish it
- To start writing, lexas the importance. The number of people who care about what you write.
- Write something so narrow you might be an expert in it
- Another constraint to relax. You don't need to publish everything
