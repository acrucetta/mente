## Notes on the Slow Food Movement

### Alice Waters, We Are What We Eat

- Buy organic food whenever possible
- Cheap and bulk is not the same as good for you or the farmers
- Buy at local shops and talk with people
- Learn to eat with the seasions; know your area. Availability at all seasons is a myth.
- Learn to make multiple meals out of a chicken (Chef Andres can make 6)
- Beware advertisement from the fast food culture industry
- Cheap is not the same as affordable. We should make food affordable, not cheap
- Growing your food is like printing your own money.
- Good food takes time, convenience can be a trap alienating us from the process of making food and where it comes from
- Convenience doesn't mean its good for local communities (e.g., DoorDash and restaurants)
