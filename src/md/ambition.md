## Notes on Ambition

> Ambition is like mass. The more you have, the stronger your gravitational pull. 

> And I’m here to argue that you should spend the time to figure out the most ambitious thing you could dream of doing with your one wild and precious life. 

> When you name your ambition, it seems that the world conspires to help you achieve it, because you become more aware of all the tools at your disposal. 

> In naming your ambition, name something big, something you can uniquely achieve.

> “To believe our own thought, to believe that what is true for you in your private heart is true for all men, -- that is genius. Speak your latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost in due time becomes the outmost.”
