## Notes on Creativity

**Source:** [You're not lacking creativity, you are overwhelmed](https://newsletter.thejorgemedina.com/p/youre-not-lacking-creativity-youre)

Creativity is composed of curation, ideation, creation, and distribution.
There is no creation without inspiration. Without curation, there is no creation. Intention is key in curation.

Curation is the art of selection. It's the filtering through the information we are exposed to and choosing what deserves our attention.
A way to capture content is using the CODE framework:
- Capture - keep what resonates
- Organize - save for actionability
- Distill - find the essence
- Express - show your work
