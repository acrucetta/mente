## Notes on how to be a human

### How to talk with people

- Attention is a gift: *attention is a moral act. It creates, brings aspects of things into being.* A person who radiates warmth will bring out the glowing side of people he meets.
- Be a loud listener: when the other person is talking, listen so actively you are burning calories. Respond with "aha", "yes" or even "amen"
- Storify whenever possible: don't ask what do you think about X? ask how did you come to believe X?
- Do the looping, especially with adolescents: paraphrase what other people are telling you
- Turn your partner into a narrator: ask more details about people's stories
- Don't be a topper: if somebody tells you they're having troubles with his teenager, don't turn around and say, "I know exactly what you mean, this things also happened to me and it's worst"

### How to ask questions

*The quality of your conversation will depend on the quality of your questions - David Brooks*

As adults we get inhibited with our questions. People are dying to tell you their stories. Very often, no one has ever asked about them.
