## CI/CD Pipelines

**What's the goal of a CI/CD pipeline?**
- Ensure changes going to a pipeline will not break other processes
- Ensure changes going to a pipeline will not break consumer's processes
- Ensure performance is not degraded by changes

**What's the ideal CI/CD pipeline?**
- Unit tests - validate logic, test individual pieces and functionality
- Integration tests - can all the jobs run?
- Full integration tests - can all the jobs run in the hardware?
