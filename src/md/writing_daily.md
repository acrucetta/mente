## Notes on Writing Daily

### From Massimo Curatella

There are two types of actions when writing:

1. Freestyle writing
2. Curating for an audience

When writing freestyle, you can use lots I think, I do, etc...

When you write for an audience you need to frame the focus on the reader. What does he know, what does he want to learn, what would he or she find useful?

When you write, you write what you know, in your own reference of mind. When you rewrite, you need to get in the reader's head and think what would that person want. How can I make their time reading this worthy?

### From Andrew Chen

Let yourself write small and use templates:
- Books reviews
- Quotes from podcast or articles
- Lessons learned
- Q&A's
- Top links about a particular topic
- Answer to a particular topic
- Reflections
- Factoids

Use distraction free devices. i.e., a laptop with only Ulysses or iA writer installed.io.

Quality can be the enemy of publishing
- Quality can hinder creativity
- Taste can develop before skill
- It can take a while to hit your stride
- Regular writing keeps the process enjoyable
- Accept failure as part of learning
