## Life Experiments

Practice Going First
- When you're at a store, say hello first, if coming across someone and you do eye contact, smile first.
- In this world, nobody is going first anymore, try volunteering first, smiling first, donating first...
- Reminder: "GO FIRST"; if you meet 1 asshole a day, you met 1 asshole, if you meet 10 its probably you

Practice not tracking 
- Cycle on/off tracking metrics in your life every once in a while.
- e.g., stop counting calories, steps, protein, meals, etc...

Exercise with others
- What if you chose exercies based on Who? first. 
- E.g., doing Acro Yoga vs. just lifting weights

Try the opposite
- If you're lifting too many weights, do yoga, if you're doing too much yoga lift weights
