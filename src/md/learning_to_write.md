## Notes on Coding and Writing

### Writing

> Writing is learned by imitation. If anyone asked me how I learned to write, Iâ€™d say I learned by reading the men and women who were doing the kind of writing I wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it. But cultivate the best models.
> Though the quest for improvement may be informed by lessons and honed by practice, it must first be kindled by a delight in the best work of the masters and a desire to approach their excellence.

### Coding

> Read great code. Go through codebases and find what works for them.
