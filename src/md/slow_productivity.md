## Principles of Slow Productivity

The principle of "slow productivity" is that by not being rushed, and by doing less, we can drive bigger results. When we are rushed and overwhelmed its hard to be creative and connect ideas.

### 1.  Do Fewer Things

- Have less 'missions'; focus on what are your top 1-2 missions this year. Focus your time on them
  - For some mathematicians it was proving a specific theorem; they focused their life around it
- Reduce the amount of ongoing projects
  - For every mission you might have more projects; each project is going to take your time away
  - Richard Feynman cultivated an attitude of being "irresponsible" that is, creating the expectation that he wouldn't respond to people right away


### 2. Work at a natural pace


### 3. Obsess over quality
