## Notes on Hard Work

I. Ideal of work

Last year, I changed my mind about hard work. I used to believe in a strict work-life balance, thinking we should only work enough to meet our needs and spend all our free time in hobbies.  Now, I've been starting to see the value of meaningful work and how putting extra hours can make your work more enjoyable. 

To me, the concept of work-life balance alienates work as something to balance against. As something separate from life. A visceral, unnecessary byproduct of having to earn a living.

I think work can be closer to Khalil Gibran's vision in "The Prophet"

*"Work is love made visible. And if you cannot work with love but only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with joy."*

Work can also provide us with dignity and fulfillment:

*"And when you work with love, you bind yourself to yourself, and to one another, and to God."*

*"For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread that feeds but half man's hunger."*

Although it can take time to get to this point. I think it's a worthy journey.

II. Finding your work: avoid bullshit first

I've tried a whole slew of jobs. To get to my current job, I worked as an operations analyst in a bank, done management consulting, and more recently I've been working as a programmer. 

Although I'd like to be as enlightened as Khalil Gibran and treat any job as a life-calling. I think there is such a thing as jobs that spark your curiosity and others that can be life-draining.

In my job as an operations analyst in Utah, I would wake up at 6 am, commute for an hour, then sit at my desk filing forms for wealthy people for 10 straight hours. 

My manager would drop a packet of 15 manila folders and I'd have to open each one, read it, and manually type the information in the bank's website.

Once I was done, I'd go to the printer, print 500 pages of documents, organize them, and head back to my desk. My second day at the job one of the interns was sobbing near the printer station lamenting her task of sitting idle by the printer for 2 hours a day.

I realized there's a whole category of jobs like this where you can spend time knowing deep down the job is meaningless and not contributing to society in any shape or form. 

David Graeber in his book "Bullshit Jobs" talks about these types of jobs.

*"A bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the case."*

*"Huge swathes of people spend their days performing jobs they secretly believe do not really need to be performed."*

*"The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is profound. It is a scar across our collective soul. Yet virtually no one talks about it."*

Now, filing accounts for trust funds could have an actual use and not be classified as bullshit job. However, since we dealt with forms that could be automated by having people filling them online put it back in the "bullshit job" category. 

Our task was to account for the fact that wealthy individuals didn't want to fill up forms online, and the bank didn't want to force them either.

I learned from this experience that bullshit jobs are real. A survey from the UK said about 37% of British workers claimed their job "didn't make a meaningful contribution to the world". 

Reading through the book I found my past job nailed a few of the Bullshit Job checklist below:

- [] Do you believe that if your job didn't exist, it wouldn't make any difference to society or anyone's well-being?
- [] Are many of your tasks or responsibilities contrived to keep you busy, rather than to accomplish something practical or beneficial?
- [] Do you spend a significant portion of your time on paperwork, meetings, or administrative tasks that seem to have little overall effect?
- [] Does your job involve solving problems that shouldn't exist or could be easily avoided?

III. Finding your work: try out things

Once you've decided you want to work on something that's meaningful to you, its important to try out a lot things. Specially early in your career.

Paul Graham in his essay "how to do great work" explained how the main way to figure out what to work on is by working. You're probably going to guess wrong multiple times and that's going to help you tune your compass on what fields you gravitate towards.

*If you don't know what to work on; take chance meetings, make yourself a big target for luck. Try lots of things, meet people, read books, ask questions*

In order to find out I enjoyed programming I worked as a AutoCAD designer, a business development intern for an oil company, an operations analyst for a bank, and as a management consultant for healthcare companies. Each of those experiences were early in my twenties, and while some were better than others they all pointed me closer to where I felt most engaged.

I didn't know what I was looking for. Some jobs I did to seek approval from my parents, others I chased for prestige and the allure of travel. Neither fulfilled me. 

The essay also warned people of *"pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politices, other people's wishes, and eminent frauds. Stick to what you find interesting"*

I find out that to avoid these traps you need to spend the time asking yourself if you're engaged in your job. A sign that you're in the right field is that it becomes increasingly interesting to you as you learn more about it.

In academic environments, specially in graduate schools (e.g., MBA) it's easy to fall into *memetic thinking* [add link], that is wishing what others want. Wanting to be in big tech, or in McKinsey, or in a hot start-up. While those are commonly good avenues for people to develop on, they can be fraught with people resenting it's not what they thought it would be.

Once you tried a few things, and found out a field that's become increasingly interesting with time. The next step is to focus and do meaningful work.

IV. Exploiting your interest, focus

Once you've found what you're interested in, you need to learn as much as you can. Build the foundational knowledge that's going to take you to the edge of the field, notice gaps, and explore promising ones.

This can't be achieved without focus. Focusing can be exponential. If you're focused on 4 things, moving to 3 can represent at 20% increase in productivity. But if you move to 1 it can represent a 400% increase.

*“People think focus means saying yes to the thing you've got to focus on. But that's not what it means at all. It means saying no to the hundred other good ideas that there are. You have to pick carefully. I'm actually as proud of the things we haven't done as the things I have done. Innovation is saying no to 1,000 things. - Steve Jobs”*

...

In the past, I worked as a management consultant, while the work was engaging at a conceptual level, I didn't feel attached to what I was doing. I had projects with nice work-life balance that were 9 to 5 and I felt miserable. And I had other projects where we worked for longer hours but I knew I was learning a lot. On the easy project, I worked for a few hours, made presentations that I knew wouldn't go anywhere and then left to a hotel. On the harder project, I
worked with a manager that pushed me to deliver high quality work even if took extra hours. I would leave the office, grab dinner, and continue refining it a bit more until it met expectations.

The easy project, what I thought had "work-life" balance felt life-draining, I wasn't contributing to anything meaningful. The harder project had challenges. It forced me to look at myself and determine what skills I was missing and how could I emulate my team members to get better. Although at the time it was brutal, I now feel a sense of accomplishment and tinge of nostalgia thinking back to high standards I was held to.

Although my career choice didn't end up being consulting, I'm now a programmer. I see the same trade-offs in this profession. 

You can either join an easy company, work for a few hours, and clock-out. That is fine. And most people do it successfully and put more value into other areas of life such as their family. However, if you're young, I'd argue it is even more important to put yourself in a position where you will be challenged.

I liked Paul Graham's easy on how to do great work. He explains how in order to do great work you have to bee deeply interested in what you're doing. As easy as it sounds, most of us don't know what we're interested in so we have to try many things. Some of these things will work out, others won't. I've tried working at a bank as an operations analyst,working as a management consultant, and now working as a programmer. The two former experiences taught me I didn't want to do that type
of work. And I wouldn't be the same with those years of trying and failing at finding what I wanted to do.

Now that I've been a programmer for 3-4 years, I've felt what it means to be interested in something. It's a gut feeling of when you're researching something, you find it more interesting the more you dig in. Where you're excited to talk about it and in your free time you can think of projects you want to try out. Or problems in your life you can solve with an Arduino or with a shell script.

Deep interest requires exploring, specially early in your career. And then explotiing with a strong focus once you find that which you enjoy.

Exploring costs less when you're younger and it increasingly becomes more expensive as you have more responsibilities such as kids or a family to take care of. Your risk appetite also decreases as you get older. Therefore, it makes sense to try and fail when you're younger.

Once you find that which you want to do, you have to focus. I liked the quote from Steve Jobs that said "focus was not saying no to something you were indifferent of, focus means saying no to an excellent opportunity because you want to concentrate on your 1 task at hand" [fill up]. Focus means starting a project and finishing it. Knowing that the best part of the project is the last 10% that takes the most amount of work. When you're working, to avoid checking social media and
immersing yourself in the content.

Once you've found what you enjoy doing, it's important to cultivate the foundation of knowledge in this field. It doesn't mean you're going to avoid the latest trends. You can know about them, but you can't become a great programmer by following front-end framework trends.

I've found in my field foundational knowledge is, if you're working with databases. Knowing how B-trees work, knowing why we index data, what are the different types of databases and why should you use NoSQL vs. SQL. If you're a back-end programmer, what constitutes a network call and whats the difference between HTTP and HTTPS.

It's easy to become distracted with the current trends, now, everyone is working on Generative AI applications. While that is a great tool to use. If you're just getting into programming it's hard to put Generative AI on a map of knowledge without knowing what came before it. 

The same as you'd build a house, you start with a solid foundation of knowledge you can put more information on top of. If you understand linear algebra, you can understand how what are the formulas behind stochastic gradient descent. If you understand those formulas, then you can understand how neural networks reduce error with each pass and improve their predictions. And so on and so forth. 

Let's say you have found your interest, you have a foundation of knowledge, and you're keen to work on something big. The next step is knowing what to work on. What do you value and what type of people you wanna be surrounded by.

Paul Graham says that to do great work, you need to 1) have a deep interest in the area and a natural aptitude, 2) put in the amount of work required, 3) the area needs to have a scope for greatness. 

We've tackled number 1 before.

The next step is putting in the amount of work required. While some people may argue you can work 35 hours a week and be productive. More hours still equals more hours, albeit at a lower productivity. If someone works 35 hours, and another person works 60 hours, the person who works 60 hours will have produced more results. 

It doesn't mean that you're going to work until exhaustion. Research shows you need to let your mind wander after working for a few hours. It helps build connections between your ideas and frankly it keeps you healthy and active for the long run. It does mean that when you're done working, you can go for a walk, do a differnet activity, but when you feel like you have another idea or a way to keep going in your work. You go back to it. Whether that is after dinner, in the
morning, or during the lunch break. 

If you're interested in it, it won't feel like work. You will have an urge to finish this task. Almost when a writer sets up a plot at the beginning of a novel you need to resolve.

It also doesn't mean that this area needs to be work you're getting paid to do on your normal hours. You can work your 9 to 5, or less. And in your off-time put in the additional time in personal projects or reading books. In fact, it is often times better to do it for yourself. It is better to solve a problem for a sample of 1 than to solve it for a fictitious refined customer.

The third point, is the area needs to have a scope for greatness. Frankly, I'm still exploring what this means for me. The area needs to have a scope for greatness.

In my experience, greatness is abstract. It depends on what your philosophy of life is. Do you care about animal welfare, climate change, healthcare costs? That'd be the first area to think about.

Within that realm, not all projects in climate change area made the same. You can either work in a large team, in a big company. Or you can work in a smaller team, where your output is visible and you know who your customer is.

Johny Ive, one of the great apple designers, says early in your career it is best to work in fast-paced start-ups with <100 people solving important problems.

You can also tell when your work has scope for greatness at a gut level. In one of my consulting projects we were cutting costs for a hospital by analyzing how many printers they needed. That was brutal. In my current company, I'm building the data infrastructure to show customers cheaper drug prices. In one project, my work was going to be a presentation where it may or may not have been implemented. In the other we were actively serving customers who were going to benefit from me
adding an extra discount card for their prescription medicine.

Decide you want to do great work. Explore your interests. Define what kind of work within that interest has scope for greatness. Then pursue it.
