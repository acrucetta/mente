-  _[Domain-Driven Design Distilled](https://www.amazon.com/Domain-Driven-Design-Distilled-Vaughn-Vernon/dp/0134434420)_ by Vaughn Vernon is a good overview of domain-driven design, which is an approach to software development that applies particularly well to working in problem domains with high essential complexity
- “Define errors out of existence” is an idea from John Ousterhout’s _[Philosophy of Software Design](https://www.amazon.com/Philosophy-Software-Design-2nd-ebook/dp/B09B8LFKQL/)_, and described with some great examples in [this page from the TCL Lang wiki](https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/Define+Errors+Out+of+Existence)
- The distinction between essential and accidental complexity, discussed in Fred Brooks’ [No Silver Bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/No_Silver_Bullet) from _[Mythical Man Month](https://www.amazon.com/Mythical-Man-Month-Software-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959)_ is a valuable dimension for reasoning about complexity (and consequently, quality)
- Kent Beck’s _[Tidy First?](https://www.amazon.com/Tidy-First-Personal-Exercise-Empirical/dp/1098151240)_ discusses a number of strategies for addressing accidental quality issues within a codebase, mostly those caused by inconsistent implementations across a large codebase. I [wrote up some notes on this book](https://lethain.com/notes-on-tidy-first/) a while back
