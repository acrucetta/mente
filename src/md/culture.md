## Writing on Culture


**Written by Dan Luu: https://danluu.com/culture/**
	- Culture is enforced by people
	- Where you start working can influence what culture you bring to other places
	- If you want to hire programmers that know how to program ask them programming questions 
	- Growing up in a culture of excellence can translate across non-related domains (e.g., skiing to engineering)
	- You can control behaviors by incentives, processes or culture
	- It's easy to become a speaker at major conferences; you just need to submit a talk proposal; same applies with blogging
	- Some skills are attitude dependent such as debugging
	- Companies have a lot of problems worth more than your expected lifetime earnings; easy to knock several a year
		- The culture can define whether people want to solve them or not
		- Monetary rewards often contribute to solving them
