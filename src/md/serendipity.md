   - Build your online presence
   - Share content on twitter
   - Write online and share it with others
   - DM people you're interested in, offer value
   - Tell people what you're looking for
   - Connect with others through real activities; not networking
   events
   - Pass the hotel bathroom principle; dress appropriately when
   going out
