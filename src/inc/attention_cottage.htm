<h2>Notes on Attention Cottages</h2>
<p>An attention cottage is a place where you can tune out the world and
focus on your most important task. Whether it be art, writing, drawing,
sketching, singing, even coding.</p>
<p>It is just you and your work.</p>
<p>It can be a room in your house or a time of the day. A "blissful"
station. Where no one can bother you. Whether it is early in the morning
or late at night. In a corner in a coffee shop, or on the train with
your phone on airplane mode.</p>
<p>We all need to cultivate this space. Otherwise our heads will become
pingball machines at the mercy of the latest news, trends, or
gossip.</p>
