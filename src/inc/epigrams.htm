<h3>Useful sayings</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>I think of strength training as a form of retirement saving. Just
as we want to retire with enough money saved up to sustain us for the
rest of our lives, we want to reach an older age with enough of a
“reserve” of muscle and bone density to protect us from injury and allow
us to pursue the activities that we enjoy. (Arnold
Schwarzenegger)</p></li>
<li><p>Help people not because they will help you back, but because you
are able to help them. (Unknown)</p></li>
<li><p>Choose beliefs that are useful, even if they're not true; e.g.
imagine a pot of gold or a tiger behind you when running.

<li><p>Find your community orchestra, where can you do things with other
people that matter, that bring joy and happiness to others, or connect
you with nature. (Unknown)</p></li>

remember the power of weak ties. (Unknown)</p></li>

<li><p>Don't worry about making things useful all the time, dare to make

<li><p>“To a disciple who was forever complaining about others, the
Master said, ‘If it is peace you want, seek to change yourself, not
other people. It is easier to protect your feet with slippers than to
carpet the whole of the earth.’” (Anthony de Mello)</p></li>

not easy to brainstorm, to learn, and to find solutions. (Arnold

<li><p>When you do a lot of practice, try to learn a bit of theory, when
you do too much theory, try to do a bit of practice. (Unknown)</p></li>
<li><p>My teacher offered this ingenious tactic: Don't tell yourself
you'll practice thirty minutes everyday. This will fail. Instead, pick
the shakuhachi up and just hold it. Of course, if you've already picked
it up, you may as well play a bit, right? (Unknown)</p></li>
<li><p>Action begets inspiration; once I start working on something I
become inspired to learn more about it. When working on a project, seek
to invest 20-30 min on it and see what parts I enjoy, do more of those.

ingredients and how you treat them. (Danny Meyer)</p></li>

any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct

find who you want to be; not who your parents want you to be, not who
your friends want you to be, and definitely not who some shyster on
Instagram or TikTok wants you to be. (Arnold Schwarzenegger)</p></li>
<li><p>Choosing to be nice is strength. Feeling compelled to always be
nice is weakness. Choosing when to be disagreeable, when required, is
strength. Always being disagreeable is weakness. (Mark Manson)</p></li>

<h3>On Work</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>“Look at this generation, with all of its electronic devices and

your ass. That’s the way it comes.” (Charlie Munger)</p></li>
