<h3>Useful sayings</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>I think of strength training as a form of retirement saving. Just
as we want to retire with enough money saved up to sustain us for the
rest of our lives, we want to reach an older age with enough of a
“reserve” of muscle and bone density to protect us from injury and allow
us to pursue the activities that we enjoy. (Arnold
Schwarzenegger)</p></li>
<li><p>Help people not because they will help you back, but because you
are able to help them. (Unknown)</p></li>
<li><p>Choose beliefs that are useful, even if they're not true; e.g.
imagine a pot of gold or a tiger behind you when running.
(Unknown)</p></li>
<li><p>Find your community orchestra, where can you do things with other
people that matter, that bring joy and happiness to others, or connect
you with nature. (Unknown)</p></li>
<li><p>Talk to an acquaintance in my industry at least once a week,
remember the power of weak ties. (Unknown)</p></li>
<li><p>If you do something scary today, you'll be creative and inspired.
You will find new solutions tomorrow. If you don't, then you will be
exactly the same. (Unknown)</p></li>
<li><p>Don't be the best, be the only. (Kevin Kelly)</p></li>
<li><p>Don't worry about making things useful all the time, dare to make
art, useless art. (Derek Sivers)</p></li>
<li><p>“To a disciple who was forever complaining about others, the
Master said, ‘If it is peace you want, seek to change yourself, not
other people. It is easier to protect your feet with slippers than to
carpet the whole of the earth.’” (Anthony de Mello)</p></li>
<li><p>It is easy to complain. Any idiot can highlight a problem. It is
not easy to brainstorm, to learn, and to find solutions. (Arnold
Schwarzenegger)</p></li>
<li><p>When you do a lot of practice, try to learn a bit of theory, when
you do too much theory, try to do a bit of practice. (Unknown)</p></li>
<li><p>My teacher offered this ingenious tactic: Don't tell yourself
you'll practice thirty minutes everyday. This will fail. Instead, pick
the shakuhachi up and just hold it. Of course, if you've already picked
it up, you may as well play a bit, right? (Unknown)</p></li>
<li><p>Action begets inspiration; once I start working on something I
become inspired to learn more about it. When working on a project, seek
to invest 20-30 min on it and see what parts I enjoy, do more of those.
(Unknown)</p></li>
<li><p>The quality of the recipe is as good as the quality of the
ingredients and how you treat them. (Danny Meyer)</p></li>
<li><p>And as the authors of “Crucial Conversations” observe, in any
conversation, respect is like air. When it’s present nobody notices it,
and when it’s absent it’s all anybody can think about. (Crucial
Conversations)</p></li>
<li><p>“Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from
any intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct
economist." (John Maynard Keynes)</p></li>
<li><p>When you take the time to sit alone with your thoughts, you can
find who you want to be; not who your parents want you to be, not who
your friends want you to be, and definitely not who some shyster on
Instagram or TikTok wants you to be. (Arnold Schwarzenegger)</p></li>
<li><p>Choosing to be nice is strength. Feeling compelled to always be
nice is weakness. Choosing when to be disagreeable, when required, is
strength. Always being disagreeable is weakness. (Mark Manson)</p></li>

<h3>On Technology</h3>
<ul>
<li>People who are more than casually interested in computers should
have at least some idea of what the underlying hardware is like.
Otherwise the programs they write will be pretty weird.— Don Knuth</li>
</ul>
<h3>On Opinions</h3>
<ul>
<li>“If your opinions on one subject can be predicted from your opinions
on another, you may be in the grip of an ideology. When you truly think
for yourself, your conclusions will not be predictable.” (Kevin
Kelly)</li>
</ul>
<h3>On Writing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nassim Taleb once wrote about how publishers always try to push
authors to write about topics specific to recent news events. “No, no;
it’s the exact opposite,” he wrote. “If you want to be read in the
future, make sure you would have been read in the past. We have no idea
of what’s in the future, but we have some knowledge of what was in the
past … I speculated that books that would have been relevant twenty
years in the past (conditional of course of being relevant today) would
be interesting twenty years in the future.”</li>
</ul>
<h3>On Work</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>“Look at this generation, with all of its electronic devices and
multitasking. I will confidently predict less success than Warren, who
just focused on reading. If you want wisdom, you’ll get it sitting on
your ass. That’s the way it comes.” (Charlie Munger)</p></li>
<li><p>Work is going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way
to be truly satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the
only way to do great work is to love what you do. (Steve Jobs)</p></li>
<li><p>Hard work is a competitive advantage. Even the belief that hard
work is a competitive advantage is itself now a competitive advantage.
(Balaji Srinivasan)</p></li>
<li><p>I’m not a consumption person; I’m a production person. I’m not
burning capital on stuff. Everything is going into the next compounding
outcome—not just compounding money, though money is an important tool.
Knowledge compounds on other knowledge. Impact, same thing. (Balaji
Srinivasan)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>On Financial Advice</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>“One of the great defenses—if you’re worried about inflation—is
not to have a lot of silly needs in your life—if you don’t need a lot of
material goods.” (Charlie Munger)</p></li>
<li><p>"The less money you need, the less dependent you are." (Balaji
Srinivasan)</p></li>
</ul>
<h3>On Philosophy</h3>
<ul>
<li>“In the human life time is but an instant, and the substance of it a
flux, and the perception dull, and the composition of the whole body
subject to putrefaction, and the soul a whirl, and fortune hard to
divine, and fame a thing devoid of certainty. And, to say all in a word,
everything that belongs to the body is a stream, and what belongs to the
soul is a dream and vapor, and life is a warfare and a stranger's
sojourn, and after- fame is oblivion. What then can guide a man? One
thing and only one, philosophy.” (Marcus Aurelius)</li>
</ul>
<h2>On efficiency</h2>
<p>“I’ll tell you what is convenient,” he said after a moment. “To sleep
until noon and have someone bring you your breakfast on a tray. To
cancel an appointment at the very last minute. To keep a carriage
waiting at the door of one party, so that on a moment’s notice it can
whisk you away to another. To sidestep marriage in your youth and put
off having children altogether. These are the greatest of conveniences,
Anushka—and at one time, I had them all. But in the end, it has been the
inconveniences that have mattered to me most.” - A Gentleman in
Moscow</p>
