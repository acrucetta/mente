<p>To teach distill what you know. Develop the theory of what you
learned by instinct and practice. By teaching you will understand your

continuously open new doors.</p>

<h3>Lex Fridman on Acquiring Skills</h3>
<p>"The way to remove motivation out of the picture is to build a
habit"</p>
<p>Be a stickler to spend at least 1h a day learning what you want to
specialize on; at least for the first 1 to 2 years</p>
<p>Build discipline so you don't have to rely on motivation; even 1
minute over time makes a huge difference</p>
<p>Anyone can become an expert on something if you spend enough time
focused on it</p>
<p>"Passion and motivation are momentary; you have to rely on habit"</p>
<h3>Theory of Learning</h3>
<p>Teaching facilitates learning; learning comes from practice. Practice
comes from passion and excitement. Passion and excitement come from
trying out things. To know what things to try out, surround yourself by
ideas and content every day.</p>
