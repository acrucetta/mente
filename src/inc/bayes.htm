<ul>
<li>Pr(H|E) = Chance of having cancer (H) given a positive test (E).
This is what we want to know: How likely is it to have cancer with a
positive result? In our case it was 7.8%.</li>
<li>Pr(E|H) = Chance of a positive test (E) given that you had cancer
(H). This is the chance of a true positive, 80% in our case.</li>
<li>Pr(H) = Chance of having cancer (1%).</li>
<li>Pr(not H) = Chance of not having cancer (99%).</li>
<li>Pr(E|not H) = Chance of a positive test (E) given that you didn’t
have cancer (not H). This is a false positive, 9.6% in our case.</li>
</ul>
<p>It comes down to the change of a <strong>true positive</strong>
divided by the change of any <strong>positive.</strong></p>

<p>It summarizes to the change Pr(E) of getting any positive result,
whether a true positive in the cancer population or a false positive in
the non-cancer population. (A weighting factor)</p>
<p>When we normalize for false positives we get the very low chance of
cancer given a positive test.</p>
