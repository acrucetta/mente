<h2>Bayes' Probability</h2>
<p><em>Take evidence and account for false positives</em></p>
<h3>Formula</h3>
<p><img src="https://betterexplained.com/ColorizedMath/img/Bayes_Theorem.png" alt="bayes illustrated" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Pr(H|E) = Chance of having cancer (H) given a positive test (E). This is what we want to know: How likely is it to have cancer with a positive result? In our case it was 7.8%.</li>
<li>Pr(E|H) = Chance of a positive test (E) given that you had cancer (H). This is the chance of a true positive, 80% in our case.</li>
<li>Pr(H) = Chance of having cancer (1%).</li>
<li>Pr(not H) = Chance of not having cancer (99%).</li>
<li>Pr(E|not H) = Chance of a positive test (E) given that you didnâ€™t have cancer (not H). This is a false positive, 9.6% in our case.</li>
</ul>
<p>It comes down to the change of a <strong>true positive</strong> divided by the change of any <strong>positive.</strong></p>

<p>It summarizes to the change Pr(E) of getting any positive result, whether a true positive in the cancer population or a false positive in the non-cancer population. (A weighting factor)</p>
<p>When we normalize for false positives we get the very low chance of cancer given a positive test.</p>
