<h2>Book Review: 1Q84</h2>
<p>Overall, this was an excellent book.</p>
<p>1Q84 tells the story of Aomame and Tengo. They met when they were 10
years old, held hands, then went their own ways. Years later, Aomame
finds herself entering a mysterious world we call 1Q84 - as a play to
the alternative year they lived in 1984.</p>
<p>As a hired killer, Aomame collaborated with the Dowager - an older
lady who tries to bring revenge to women abused by their husbands.
Together, they find the abusers and kill them.</p>
<p>Tengo's story starts when he gets a request to rewrite the novel "Air
Chrysallis"; originally written by Fuka-Eri. This novel reveals the
hidden world of the "Little People". While we don't find out much about
them, they are connected to a cult called Sagikake that was involved in
molesting children.</p>
<p>The novel unravels around the release of the novel and how it exposes
the "Little People". It turns out the Air Chrysallis story shows the
inner workings of the little people. Disgusted by it, the little people
turn to the cult to targe Tengo Kawana and stop him from promoting the
novel.</p>
<p>The main themes around this novel were romanting love and connection,
abuse in relationships and in cults, familial love, and gender
imbalances in Japan.</p>
<p>We learn about Tengo's complicated relationship with his father. How
despite growing up without his mother, his father tried his best to
raise Tengo. Even though he hated his childhood, later in the story
Tengo learned to appreciate his father. He started to empathize what it
would be like raising a child without a wife.</p>
<p>We also learn about Aomame's fervor in finding true love. Longing
throughout the book to find someone who understood her and woud love her
for who she was.</p>
<p>We learn about 1980's Japan and the many gender dynamics that still
remained in the country. Where women were expected to play domestic
roles in the house.</p>
<p>We finally learn the power of ideology in capturing people's minds.
The abuse it imposes on children, and the extend people go to cover up
issues inside of these cults.</p>
<p>I would highly recommend this book and give it a A rating.</p>
