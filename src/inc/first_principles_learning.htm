<h2>First Principles Learning</h2>
<p>Elon’s mental model for learning quickly is the ‘Knowledge Tree.’The
idea is to view knowledge as a tree so you can break it into bits.For
example, ‘Trunks and big branches’ VS ‘Leaves and fruits’.</p>
<p>Trunk - old books, biographies, history, super texts. Teach you the
principles and fundamentals. True timeless wisdom. Fruits - new books,
blogs, podcasts. Consume to look at things in a new way. Leaves - news
and noise.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Knowledge is a semantic tree; you need to understand the fundamental
principles. The trunk and big branches before you get to the leaves</p>
