<h3>Glossary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daimon</strong>: The daimon is then equivalent to the
Reason, to the self, to the intellect (nous), to the power of reflection
(dianoia), and to the guiding principle (hegemonikon). [<a

<li><strong>Ruling power</strong>: when Marcus Aurelius says "our ruling
power," he is referring to the human mind, and he is reminding us that
we have the power to choose how we live our lives</li>
</ul>
<h3>Book 3</h3>
<p>Marcus Aurelius starts with a reflection on the shortness of life and
the importance of a sense of urgency and a zest to cultivate knowledge
and live according to nature</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We ought to consider not only that our life is daily wasting away,
but also that if a man should live longer, it is quite uncertain whether
the understanding will still continue sufficient for the comprehension
of things</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>... we must make hast then, not only because we are daily near to
death, but also because the conception of things and the understanding
of them cease first</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also encourages us to <em>observe that even the things which
follow after the things that are produced according to nature contain
something pleasing and attractive</em></p>
<p>In his life, he seemed to have to remind himself how if we appreciate
the nature in everything, we will see with no less pleasure the <em>real
gaping jaws of wild beasts</em> than those that painters and sculptors
show by imitation. We are able to look at the comeliness of old men and
to look at young beauty with chaste eyes.</p>
<p>He continued with emphasizing to not <em>waste the remainder of your
life in thoughts about others</em>. When we care too much about what a
person is doing, why, and what is he saying, and what he thinks of us,
we steer away from our ruling power.</p>
<p>He says our activity should concentrate in our own lot, making your
own actions fair and being persuaded that your portion is good.</p>
