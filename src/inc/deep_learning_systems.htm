<h2>Notes on Deep Learning Systems</h2>
<h2>Week 1</h2>
<h3>On Writing</h3>
<ul>
<li>Use writing as you're learning to log your lessons</li>
<li>Keep a learning journal where you explore ideas, ask questions, and
experiment with concepts</li>
<li>Write to discover and explain complex concepts to yourself</li>
<li>Practice diff techniques: aha statements, quick writes, edit for
clarity</li>
<li>Connect ideas, ask questions and summarize key points</li>
</ul>
<h3>Situational Awareness</h3>
<p>We might be able to reach AGI by 2027. There have been dramatic
changes in compute, algorithm efficiency, and scale of training
clusters.</p>
<p>GPTs have outperformed all predictions by experts now being able to
perform at PhD level in many fields of knowledge. We can expect to
continue these improvements over time.</p>
