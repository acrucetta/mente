<h2>Virtual Machines</h2>
<p>A virtual machine is a program that acts like a computer. It simulates a CPU along with a few other hardware components.</p>
<p>VMs allow us to port programs into several CPUs. </p>

<p>The only cost is the overhead of the VM itself and the further abstraction from the machine. This is a trade-off that's taken.</p>
<p>Ethereum smart contracts are examples of virtual machines. They are run inside of a VM that has no access to the file system, network, disc, etc...</p>
<p><strong>Instruction Set</strong></p>
<p>Instructions have both an opcode and a set of parameters.</p>
<p>Each opcode represents tasks the CPU &quot;knows&quot; how to do. </p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<pre><code class="language-c">enum
{
    OP_BR = 0, /* branch */
    OP_ADD,    /* add  */
    OP_LD,     /* load */
    OP_ST,     /* store */
    OP_JSR,    /* jump register */
    OP_AND,    /* bitwise and */
    OP_LDR,    /* load register */
    OP_STR,    /* store register */
    OP_RTI,    /* unused */
    OP_NOT,    /* bitwise not */
    OP_LDI,    /* load indirect */
    OP_STI,    /* store indirect */
    OP_JMP,    /* jump */
    OP_RES,    /* reserved (unused) */
    OP_LEA,    /* load effective address */
    OP_TRAP    /* execute trap */
};

<p>Assembly language is a readable and writable form encoded in plain text. A tool called an {assembler} transforms each line of text into a 16-bit binary.</p>

<p>An assembler convers assembly language (already low level) into machine code. The compiler translates high-level source code into lower level languages like assembly code or machine code.</p>
