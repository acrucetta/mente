<h2>Notes on Writing Daily</h2>
<h3>From Massimo Curatella</h3>
<p>There are two types of actions when writing:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Freestyle writing</li>
<li>Curating for an audience</li>
</ol>
<p>When writing freestyle, you can use lots I think, I do, etc...</p>
<p>When you write for an audience you need to frame the focus on the
reader. What does he know, what does he want to learn, what would he or
she find useful?</p>
<p>When you write, you write what you know, in your own reference of
mind. When you rewrite, you need to get in the reader's head and think
what would that person want. How can I make their time reading this
worthy?</p>
<h3>From Andrew Chen</h3>
<p>Let yourself write small and use templates:</p>
<ul>
<li>Books reviews</li>
<li>Quotes from podcast or articles</li>
<li>Lessons learned</li>
<li>Q&amp;A's</li>
<li>Top links about a particular topic</li>
<li>Answer to a particular topic</li>
<li>Reflections</li>
<li>Factoids</li>
</ul>
<p>Use distraction free devices. i.e., a laptop with only Ulysses or iA
writer installed.io.</p>
<p>Quality can be the enemy of publishing</p>
<ul>
<li>Quality can hinder creativity</li>
<li>Taste can develop before skill</li>
<li>It can take a while to hit your stride</li>
<li>Regular writing keeps the process enjoyable</li>
<li>Accept failure as part of learning</li>
</ul>
