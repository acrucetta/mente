<h2>Life Experiments</h2>
<p>Practice Going First</p>
<ul>
<li>When you're at a store, say hello first, if coming across someone
and you do eye contact, smile first.</li>
<li>In this world, nobody is going first anymore, try volunteering
first, smiling first, donating first...</li>
<li>Reminder: "GO FIRST"; if you meet 1 asshole a day, you met 1
asshole, if you meet 10 its probably you</li>
</ul>
<p>Practice not tracking</p>
<ul>
<li>Cycle on/off tracking metrics in your life every once in a
while.</li>
<li>e.g., stop counting calories, steps, protein, meals, etc...</li>
</ul>
<p>Exercise with others</p>
<ul>
<li>What if you chose exercies based on Who? first.</li>
<li>E.g., doing Acro Yoga vs. just lifting weights</li>
</ul>

</ul>
