<h2>Notes on Copywork</h2>
<p>Copywork, as it’s called, used to be the standard method by which
students learned to write, and it is the “secret” to how many of
history’s greatest writers mastered the craft.</p>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<p>n fact this is how every artist in every creative discipline works.
Musicians develop vocabulary by learning other people’s work, painters
develop technique by copying the masters.</p>
<p>Once you understand how the greats do it, you are then able to take a
mix of their techniques and principles and blend them into your own
style.</p>
<p>A very good way to learn how to craft words - in fact the only way
really, even if you never realised you were doing it.</p>

<h3>Copywork Exercise</h3>
<p>Instead of transcribing essays word for word, Franklin’s copywork
exercise looked like this</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Read essay.</li>
<li>Make notes for each sentence that he read and set it aside.</li>
<li>Look at notes and try to replicate essay in his own words (he’d
sometimes jumble up his notes to make the exercise even more
difficult).</li>
<li>Compare his version to the original.</li>
<li>Revise and improve his version.</li>
</ol>
