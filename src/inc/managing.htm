<h2>Notes on Managing People</h2>
<h3>On providing enough context</h3>
<p>There are many aspects to delegating well, but one that I think is
underrated is this: Taking the time upfront to explain a project
thoughtfully.</p>
<p>Instead, many managers toss a request over the wall with zero context
and say “do this.”</p>
<p>Here are five areas to cover:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Increase comprehension: Am I explaining in a way that’s easy to
understand?</li>
<li>Increase buy-in: Am I getting the person excited?</li>
<li>Derisk: Am I addressing obvious risks?</li>
<li>Confirm alignment: Am I giving them a chance to speak up?</li>
<li>Feedback loop: Am I creating the shortest feedback loop
possible?</li>
</ol>
