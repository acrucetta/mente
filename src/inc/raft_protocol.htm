<p>Overview</p>
<ul>
<li>Raft is a protocol for implementing distributed consensus.</li>
</ul>
<p>Leader Election</p>
<ul>
<li>All nodes start as followers, they can become candidates or leaders
over time</li>
<li>The candidate becomes the majority if it receives most of the
votes</li>
<li>Each node has an <em>election timeout</em> (150-300ms), after a
certain time it asks other nodes for a vote. If the node hasn't voted it
will vote for the requesting node</li>
<li>To commit an entry, the node replicates the value to the
followers</li>
<li>Messages are sent across nodes in "heartbeat timeouts"</li>
</ul>
<p>Log Replication</p>
<ul>
<li>The leader receives a message</li>
<li>Then it sends it to the other nodes via a "heartbeat"</li>
<li>Once it receives the reply back, it sends back an acknowledge
message to the client</li>
</ul>
<p>Network issues</p>
<ul>
<li>Raft can sustain network partitions. If the client wants to change a
node, and the partition has a majority, then it succeeds. It will send
the message to the other nodes after.</li>
</ul>
