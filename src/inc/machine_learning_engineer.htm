<p>E.g.
https://jobs.lever.co/imbue/9411e2ec-502a-403f-a39a-0d44c676b6afi</p>
<p>Example projects • Implement a self-supervised network using
contrastive and reconstruction losses. • Create a library on top of
PyTorch to enable efficient network architecture search. • Open source
internal tools. • Implement networks from newly published papers. • Work
on tools for simple distributed parallel training of deep neural
networks. • Develop more realistic simulations for training our agents.
• Design automated methods and tools to prevent common issues with
neural network training (e.g. overfitting, vanishing gradients, dead
ReLUs, etc). • Create visualizations to help us deeply understand what
our networks learn and why.</p>
<p>You are • Very comfortable writing Python. • Familiar with PyTorch
and training deep neural networks. • Excited to work on open source
code. • Passionate about engineering best practices. • Self-directed and
independent. • Excellent at getting things done.</p>
