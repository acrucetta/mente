<h2>Notes from a Mind at Play</h2>
<p>Things to remember from the book:</p>
<ul>
<li>What is information theory?</li>
<li>How was it defined?</li>
<li>What was Bool's influence in Claude Shannon?</li>
<li>How did Claude Shannon use logic theory as inspiration for
information theory?</li>
<li>What are bits as defined by Claude Shannon?</li>
<li>Why did it take long for people to come up with information
theory?</li>
<li>Where was it used first?</li>
<li>What is the mathematical underpinning behind information
theory?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> A mind at play was the biography of Claude
Shannon and the information age. This book has been illuminating in the
sense that it introduced me to the beginning of the information theory
and how we defined bits.</p>
<p>The book begins with Claude Shannon's early life as an introver but
brilliant scientist...</p>
