<p>Some notes:</p>
<ul>
<li>We move cash card pricing and medispan data from SFTP and Blob to
Postgres; then we move it to Snowflake and Elastic Search</li>
<li>We move the cashwrap claims data from SFTP and Blob to Snowflake
directly, bypassing Postgres</li>
<li>We move the ISP hide prices feed from Snowflake to Postgres and
ultimately Elastic Search</li>
</ul>
