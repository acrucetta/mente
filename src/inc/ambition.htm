<h2>Notes on Ambition</h2>
<blockquote>
<p>Ambition is like mass. The more you have, the stronger your
gravitational pull.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>And I’m here to argue that you should spend the time to figure out
the most ambitious thing you could dream of doing with your one wild and
precious life.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>When you name your ambition, it seems that the world conspires to
help you achieve it, because you become more aware of all the tools at
your disposal.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In naming your ambition, name something big, something you can
uniquely achieve.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“To believe our own thought, to believe that what is true for you in
your private heart is true for all men, -- that is genius. Speak your
latent conviction, and it shall be the universal sense; for the inmost
in due time becomes the outmost.”</p>
