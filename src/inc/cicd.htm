<p><strong>What’s the goal of a CI/CD pipeline?</strong> - Ensure
changes going to a pipeline will not break other processes - Ensure
changes going to a pipeline will not break consumer’s processes - Ensure
performance is not degraded by changes</p>
<p><strong>What’s the ideal CI/CD pipeline?</strong> - Unit tests -
validate logic, test individual pieces and functionality - Integration
tests - can all the jobs run? - Full integration tests - can all the
jobs run in the hardware?</p>
