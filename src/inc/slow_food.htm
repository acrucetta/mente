<h2>Notes on the Slow Food Movement</h2>
<h3>Alice Waters, We Are What We Eat</h3>
<ul>
<li>Buy organic food whenever possible</li>
<li>Cheap and bulk is not the same as good for you or the farmers</li>
<li>Buy at local shops and talk with people</li>
<li>Learn to eat with the seasions; know your area. Availability at all
seasons is a myth.</li>
<li>Learn to make multiple meals out of a chicken (Chef Andres can make
6)</li>
<li>Beware advertisement from the fast food culture industry</li>
<li>Cheap is not the same as affordable. We should make food affordable,
not cheap</li>
<li>Growing your food is like printing your own money.</li>
<li>Good food takes time, convenience can be a trap alienating us from
the process of making food and where it comes from</li>
<li>Convenience doesn't mean its good for local communities (e.g.,
DoorDash and restaurants)</li>
</ul>
