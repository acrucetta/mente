<p><em>Redundant Array of Independent Disks</em></p>
<p><strong>Key Terms</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Parity</strong>: Parity is a method used in some RAID levels
(like RAID 5 and 6) to provide fault tolerance. It's a calculated value
that can be used to reconstruct data if a drive fails.</li>
<li><strong>Stripe Size</strong>: Stripe size refers to the amount of
data written to each disk in a RAID array before moving to the next
disk.</li>
</ul>
<p>RAID is a storage technology that combines multiple disk drive
components into a logical unit for data redundancy and performance
improvement.</p>
<p>RAID works by <strong>distributing data across multiple
drives</strong> in one of several ways, depending on the RAID level. The
most common methods are:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Striping</strong>: Splitting data across multiple
drives</li>
<li><strong>Mirroring</strong>: Duplicating data on separate drives</li>
<li><strong>Parity</strong>: Storing calculated recovery
information</li>
</ol>
<p>Key RAID levels:</p>
<ul>
<li>RAID 0 (Striping):
<ul>
<li>Data is split across drives</li>
<li>Improves performance, no redundancy</li>
<li>Example: A 100MB file on 2 drives might use 50MB on each</li>
</ul></li>
<li>RAID 1 (Mirroring):
<ul>
<li>Data is duplicated on separate drives</li>
<li>Provides redundancy, slightly improves read performance</li>
<li>Example: A 100MB file is written identically to 2 drives</li>
</ul></li>
<li>RAID 5 (Striping with distributed parity):
<ul>
<li>Data and parity are distributed across all drives</li>
<li>Good balance of performance and redundancy</li>
<li>Example: In a 4-drive array, 3 parts data + 1 part parity per
stripe, rotating parity location</li>
</ul></li>
<li>RAID 6 (Striping with double distributed parity):
<ul>
<li>Similar to RAID 5, but with two parity calculations</li>
<li>Higher redundancy, can survive two drive failures</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Example: Imagine RAID 5 as a team of 4 writers working on a book.
Three write content, while one summarizes (parity). If one writer is
lost, their work can be reconstructed from the summary and other
writers' work.</p>
