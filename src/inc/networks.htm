<h2>Computer Networking: A Top Down Approach</h2>
<h3>Chapter 1</h3>
<p>The internet is a computer network that connects hundreds of millions of computing devices.</p>
<p>These devices are called hosts or end systems. They're connected by communication links and packet switches.</p>
<p>Different links can transmit data at different rates. Measured in bits/second. When one system sends data to another. It adds headers and bytes to each segment. This is known as packets.</p>
<p>End systems access the internet through Internet Service Providers. Each ISP network runs the IP protocol and conforms to naming and address conventions.</p>
<p>These systems run protocols; including the Transmission Control Protocol and the Internet Protocol.</p>
<p>The internet is also an infrastructure for providing services to distributed applications.</p>
<p>The internet is built of protocols, they defined the format and order of messages exchanged by two or more entities, as well as the actions taken on the transmission and/or receipt of a message or other event.</p>
<p>End systems can be divided into clients and servers. A client program is a running one end systems that requests and receives a service from a server program. They are distributed applications.</p>
<p>THe physical medium includes how the bits will travel from one system to the other. They can be guided or unguided. In guided ones, we have a solid medium (optic cable). In unguided the waves propagate in the atmosphere (e.g., wireless LAN or digital satellite)</p>
