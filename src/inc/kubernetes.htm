<h2>Kubernetes</h2>
<p>Came with the rise of microservices; we now use dozens of containers across different environments </p>
<p>Kubernetes guarantees:</p>
<ul>
<li>high availability or no downtime</li>
<li>scalability or high performance</li>
<li>disaster recovery - backup and restore</li>
</ul>
<p>Basic architecture:</p>
<ul>
<li>Linux Master Node (lightweight)
<ul>
<li>Worker node (heavy weight) with &quot;kubelet&quot; processes inside each of them</li>
<li>Each worker node has containers with applications running inside of them</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The master node runs Kubernetes processes which include: 
<ul>
<li>API server (entry point to K8S cluster). </li>
<li>Controller manager - keeps track of what's happening in the cluster</li>
<li>Scheduler - ensures pod placement </li>
<li>etcd - key value storage; current state </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Virtual network unified by a powerful machine connected to all of the nodes</li>
</ul>
