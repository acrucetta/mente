<h2 id="application-logging">Application Logging</h2>
<p>Logs should be greppable. It should be focused entirely on a single
line of log. NEVER over multiple lines.</p>
<p>We want to answer questions such as: - When did user 55 last log in?
- Is our incoming connection receiving messages? - How many times did
our web server go dead? - Did any transaction fail to complete?</p>
<p>Problems to avoid: 1. Log is missing necessary information 2. Log
unsuitable for grep because of redundant information (if it mentions a
website on every linge we can’t find those that were activated by the
website) 3. Information is split across more than one line 4. Error
reported to user but not logged</p>
<p>e.g.,</p>
<p>try { do something } catch { do nothing }</p>
<p>Logs can be saved into multiple files depending on how often they
happen: - Message log - Connection log - Stacktrace log</p>
<p>Logs must contain timestamps with timezone, to the millisecond or
nanosecond.</p>
<p>Always log to local disk, don’t try to log to the network or to
shared folders.</p>
