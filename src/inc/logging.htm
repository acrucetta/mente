<h2>Application Logging</h2>
<p>Logs should be greppable. It should be focused entirely on a single
line of log. NEVER over multiple lines.</p>
<p>We want to answer questions such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>When did user 55 last log in?</li>
<li>Is our incoming connection receiving messages?</li>
<li>How many times did our web server go dead?</li>
<li>Did any transaction fail to complete?</li>
</ul>
<p>Problems to avoid:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Log is missing necessary information</li>
<li>Log unsuitable for grep because of redundant information (if it
mentions a website on every linge we can't find those that were
activated by the website)</li>
<li>Information is split across more than one line</li>
<li>Error reported to user but not logged</li>
</ol>
<p>e.g.,</p>
<p>try { do something } catch { do nothing }</p>
<p>Logs can be saved into multiple files depending on how often they
happen:</p>
<ul>
<li>Message log</li>
<li>Connection log</li>
<li>Stacktrace log</li>
</ul>
<p>Logs must contain timestamps with timezone, to the millisecond or
nanosecond.</p>
<p>Always log to local disk, don't try to log to the network or to
shared folders.</p>
