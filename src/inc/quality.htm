<h2>Notes on Quality</h2>
<h3>Cal Newport on Obsessing Over Quality</h3>
<p>To make quality work you need to build a taste for great work. To do
that you need to imitate great people until you build your style.</p>
<p>You can also watch people doing the work you normally do; what makes
it different. What tools they use, how do they think about the work.</p>
<p>You should also think critically about the work and why do some
designs work better than others.</p>
<p>What makes for good writing, for good filmatography, or for good
coding?</p>
<h3>From Google's Developer Productivity Research</h3>
<p>Developer productivity can be split into: speed, ease and
quality.</p>
<p>Quality can be further split into:</p>
<ul>
<li>Process quality</li>
<li>Code quality</li>
<li>System quality</li>
<li>Product quality</li>
</ul>

<p>Process quality includes having comprehensive and deterministic
testing, thorough code revies, organizational consistency and effective
planning. Process based metrics can be more predictive of post-release
defects than code quality measures.</p>
<p>Code quality includes maintainability, testability,
comprehensibility, complexity and readibility. It can be described as
how easy it is to understand a code base and add features. Code quality
improves sytem quality and gives a higher velocity to developers.</p>
<p>System quality is characterized by reliability, performance and
defect rates. It happens as a result of process quality and code
quality. It can be seen as a lagging indicator of the former. To track
system quality the process and code metrics can be more illuminating
than the defect rates or the "relliability" of the system.</p>
<p>Product quality is defined by utility, usability, and reliability.
Low code quality can slow engineering velocity and delay product
improvements.</p>
