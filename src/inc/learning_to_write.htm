<h2>Notes on Coding and Writing</h2>
<h3>Writing</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Writing is learned by imitation. If anyone asked me how I learned to
write, Iâ€™d say I learned by reading the men and women who were doing the
kind of writing I wanted to do and trying to figure out how they did it.
But cultivate the best models. Though the quest for improvement may be
informed by lessons and honed by practice, it must first be kindled by a
delight in the best work of the masters and a desire to approach their
excellence.</p>

<h3>Coding</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Read great code. Go through codebases and find what works for
them.</p>
