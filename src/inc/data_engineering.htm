<h2>What is a Data Engineer</h2>

<p>
  The data engineer is a hub between data producers, such as software engineers,
  data architects, and DevOps or site-reliability engineers (SREs), and data
  consumers, such as data analysts, data scientists, and ML engineers. In
  addition, data engineers will interact with those in operational roles, such
  as DevOps engineers.

<p>
  Data engineering is all about the movement, manipulation, and management of
  data.
