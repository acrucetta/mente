<ul>
<li>Culture is enforced by people</li>
<li>Where you start working can influence what culture you bring to
other places</li>
<li>If you want to hire programmers that know how to program ask them
programming questions</li>
<li>Growing up in a culture of excellence can translate across
non-related domains (e.g., skiing to engineering)</li>
<li>You can control behaviors by incentives, processes or culture</li>
<li>Itâ€™s easy to become a speaker at major conferences; you just need to
submit a talk proposal; same applies with blogging</li>
<li>Some skills are attitude dependent such as debugging</li>
<li>Companies have a lot of problems worth more than your expected
lifetime earnings; easy to knock several a year
<ul>
<li>The culture can define whether people want to solve them or not</li>
<li>Monetary rewards often contribute to solving them</li>
</ul></li>
