<p>Unlike statistics, machine learning deals with large and complex
datasets. It is fundamentally an engineering discipline. Unlike
theoretical physics or mathematics it is a very hands on field driven by
empirical findings and deeply reliant on advances in software and
hardware.</p>
<p>The central problem is how can we meaningfully transform data, in
other words, learn useful representations of the input at hand to get us
closer to the expected output.</p>
