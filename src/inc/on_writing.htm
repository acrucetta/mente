<h1>Notes on Writing</h1>
<h2>Paul Graham</h2>
<p>How to write clearly</p>
<ul>
<li>Use simple words; easier words means people focus on the ideas and
not on the prose</li>
<li>When you write in a fancy way you make readers do extra work</li>
<li>Writing simply exposes ideas for what they are</li>
<li>When you write sentences with fancy words it can be offensive and
clumsy</li>
<li>Write the first draft then spend time editing it. Cutting.</li>
</ul>
<p>How to write usefully</p>
<ul>
<li>Importance + Novelty + Correctness + Strength</li>
<li>Its OK to use "I think" to classify the certainty of your ideas. It
also makes you sound less pretentious.</li>
<li>Use writing as a tool to think</li>
<li>Loose then tight. Write the first draft fast trying out many ideas;
then rewrite carefully</li>
<li>Make something you want. The reader is not completely unlike
you</li>
<li>To get novelty, write about things you've thought a lot. Anything
that surprises you.
<ul>
<li>If you don't learn anything from an essay don't publish it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>To start writing, lexas the importance. The number of people who
care about what you write.</li>
<li>Write something so narrow you might be an expert in it</li>
<li>Another constraint to relax. You don't need to publish
everything</li>
</ul>
