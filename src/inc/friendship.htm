<h2>Friendship</h2>
<h3>First Stages</h3>
<p>At the first stages of friendship, it's important to be available, to
make time to hang out, without a purpose.</p>
<p>Propose times to meet-up, build a connection 1 on 1. Unite over
common interests.</p>
<p>Over time, we can let the schedules dictate more when to spend time
together and it doesn't need to be as often if it's not possible.</p>
<p>But the first stages are crucial, like a seedling in a garden we must
nurture it and help it grow to a stable plant.</p>
<p>Many a times I've seen the impact of letting go of a friendship at
the beginning, specially when you're moving to a new city. You decide to
meet up, and then let the busyness of life separate each other until
forgetfulness ensues.</p>
<h3>Types of friends</h3>
<p>Aristotle, in his Nicomachean Ethics.[25] He argued that friendships
can be classified along a kind of ladder. At the bottom rung—where
people are least connected emotionally, so the commitment is weakest—are
the deal friends based on utility to each other in work or social life.
These are colleagues, partners to a transaction, or simply those who can
do each other favors. Higher up are friendships based on
pleasure—something you like and admire about the other person, such as
their intelligence or sense of humor. At the highest level are
friendships of virtue, or what Aristotle called “perfect friendship.”
These friendships are an end in themselves, and not instrumental to
anything else.</p>
