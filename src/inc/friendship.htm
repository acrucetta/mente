<h2 id="friendship">Friendship</h2>
<h3 id="types-of-friends">Types of friends</h3>
<p>Aristotle, in his Nicomachean Ethics.[25] He argued that friendships
can be classified along a kind of ladder. At the bottom rung—where
people are least connected emotionally, so the commitment is weakest—are
the deal friends based on utility to each other in work or social life.
These are colleagues, partners to a transaction, or simply those who can
do each other favors. Higher up are friendships based on
pleasure—something you like and admire about the other person, such as
their intelligence or sense of humor. At the highest level are
friendships of virtue, or what Aristotle called “perfect friendship.”
These friendships are an end in themselves, and not instrumental to
anything else.</p>
