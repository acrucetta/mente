<h2>Notes on Hard Work</h2>
<p>I. Ideal of work</p>
<p>Last year, I changed my mind about hard work. I used to believe in a
strict work-life balance, thinking we should only work enough to meet
our needs and spend all our free time in hobbies. Now, I've been
starting to see the value of meaningful work and how putting extra hours
can make your work more enjoyable.</p>
<p>To me, the concept of work-life balance alienates work as something
to balance against. As something separate from life. A visceral,
unnecessary byproduct of having to earn a living.</p>
<p>I think work can be closer to Khalil Gibran's vision in "The
Prophet"</p>
<p><em>"Work is love made visible. And if you cannot work with love but
only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit
at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with
joy."</em></p>
<p>Work can also provide us with dignity and fulfillment:</p>
<p><em>"And when you work with love, you bind yourself to yourself, and
to one another, and to God."</em></p>
<p><em>"For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread
that feeds but half man's hunger."</em></p>
<p>Although it can take time to get to this point. I think it's a worthy
journey.</p>
<p>II. Finding your work: avoid bullshit first</p>
<p>I've tried a whole slew of jobs. To get to my current job, I worked
as an operations analyst in a bank, done management consulting, and more
recently I've been working as a programmer.</p>
<p>Although I'd like to be as enlightened as Khalil Gibran and treat any
job as a life-calling. I think there is such a thing as jobs that spark
your curiosity and others that can be life-draining.</p>
<p>In my job as an operations analyst in Utah, I would wake up at 6 am,
commute for an hour, then sit at my desk filing forms for wealthy people
for 10 straight hours.</p>
<p>My manager would drop a packet of 15 manila folders and I'd have to
open each one, read it, and manually type the information in the bank's
website.</p>
<p>Once I was done, I'd go to the printer, print 500 pages of documents,
organize them, and head back to my desk. My second day at the job one of
the interns was sobbing near the printer station lamenting her task of
sitting idle by the printer for 2 hours a day.</p>
<p>I realized there's a whole category of jobs like this where you can
spend time knowing deep down the job is meaningless and not contributing
to society in any shape or form.</p>
<p>David Graeber in his book "Bullshit Jobs" talks about these types of
jobs.</p>
<p><em>"A bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so
completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee
cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of
employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the
case."</em></p>
<p><em>"Huge swathes of people spend their days performing jobs they
secretly believe do not really need to be performed."</em></p>
<p><em>"The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is
profound. It is a scar across our collective soul. Yet virtually no one
talks about it."</em></p>
<p>Now, filing accounts for trust funds could have an actual use and not
be classified as bullshit job. However, since we dealt with forms that
could be automated by having people filling them online put it back in
the "bullshit job" category.</p>
<p>Our task was to account for the fact that wealthy individuals didn't
want to fill up forms online, and the bank didn't want to force them
either.</p>
<p>I learned from this experience that bullshit jobs are real. A survey
from the UK said about 37% of British workers claimed their job "didn't
make a meaningful contribution to the world".</p>
<p>Reading through the book I found my past job nailed a few of the
Bullshit Job checklist below:</p>
<ul>
<li>[] Do you believe that if your job didn't exist, it wouldn't make
any difference to society or anyone's well-being?</li>
<li>[] Are many of your tasks or responsibilities contrived to keep you
busy, rather than to accomplish something practical or beneficial?</li>
<li>[] Do you spend a significant portion of your time on paperwork,
meetings, or administrative tasks that seem to have little overall
effect?</li>
<li>[] Does your job involve solving problems that shouldn't exist or
could be easily avoided?</li>
</ul>
<p>III. Finding your work: try out things</p>

[importance of exploring early on in your career - Paul Graham] [cost of
exploring later on and using your knowledge]</p>
<p><em>The irony is not lost on me that I end up doing management
consulting for 2 years after college. A profession that is often
criticized for being fraught with busy work and sometimes only existing
to validate management's existing plan.</em></p>
<p>[Once you start exploring, work and focus as hard as you can]</p>

<p>...</p>
<p>In the past, I worked as a management consultant, while the work was
engaging at a conceptual level, I didn't feel attached to what I was
doing. I had projects with nice work-life balance that were 9 to 5 and I
felt miserable. And I had other projects where we worked for longer
hours but I knew I was learning a lot. On the easy project, I worked for
a few hours, made presentations that I knew wouldn't go anywhere and
then left to a hotel. On the harder project, I worked with a manager
that pushed me to deliver high quality work even if took extra hours. I
would leave the office, grab dinner, and continue refining it a bit more
until it met expectations.</p>
<p>The easy project, what I thought had "work-life" balance felt
life-draining, I wasn't contributing to anything meaningful. The harder
project had challenges. It forced me to look at myself and determine
what skills I was missing and how could I emulate my team members to get
better. Although at the time it was brutal, I now feel a sense of
accomplishment and tinge of nostalgia thinking back to high standards I
was held to.</p>
<p>Although my career choice didn't end up being consulting, I'm now a
programmer. I see the same trade-offs in this profession.</p>
<p>You can either join an easy company, work for a few hours, and
clock-out. That is fine. And most people do it successfully and put more
value into other areas of life such as their family. However, if you're
young, I'd argue it is even more important to put yourself in a position
where you will be challenged.</p>
<p>I liked Paul Graham's easy on how to do great work. He explains how
in order to do great work you have to bee deeply interested in what
you're doing. As easy as it sounds, most of us don't know what we're
interested in so we have to try many things. Some of these things will
work out, others won't. I've tried working at a bank as an operations
analyst,working as a management consultant, and now working as a
programmer. The two former experiences taught me I didn't want to do
that type of work. And I wouldn't be the same with those years of trying
and failing at finding what I wanted to do.</p>
<p>Now that I've been a programmer for 3-4 years, I've felt what it
means to be interested in something. It's a gut feeling of when you're
researching something, you find it more interesting the more you dig in.
Where you're excited to talk about it and in your free time you can
think of projects you want to try out. Or problems in your life you can
solve with an Arduino or with a shell script.</p>
<p>Deep interest requires exploring, specially early in your career. And
then explotiing with a strong focus once you find that which you
enjoy.</p>
<p>Exploring costs less when you're younger and it increasingly becomes
more expensive as you have more responsibilities such as kids or a
family to take care of. Your risk appetite also decreases as you get
older. Therefore, it makes sense to try and fail when you're
younger.</p>
<p>Once you find that which you want to do, you have to focus. I liked
the quote from Steve Jobs that said "focus was not saying no to
something you were indifferent of, focus means saying no to an excellent
opportunity because you want to concentrate on your 1 task at hand"
[fill up]. Focus means starting a project and finishing it. Knowing that
the best part of the project is the last 10% that takes the most amount
of work. When you're working, to avoid checking social media and
immersing yourself in the content.</p>
<p>Once you've found what you enjoy doing, it's important to cultivate
the foundation of knowledge in this field. It doesn't mean you're going
to avoid the latest trends. You can know about them, but you can't
become a great programmer by following front-end framework trends.</p>
<p>I've found in my field foundational knowledge is, if you're working
with databases. Knowing how B-trees work, knowing why we index data,
what are the different types of databases and why should you use NoSQL
vs. SQL. If you're a back-end programmer, what constitutes a network
call and whats the difference between HTTP and HTTPS.</p>
<p>It's easy to become distracted with the current trends, now, everyone
is working on Generative AI applications. While that is a great tool to
use. If you're just getting into programming it's hard to put Generative
AI on a map of knowledge without knowing what came before it.</p>
<p>The same as you'd build a house, you start with a solid foundation of
knowledge you can put more information on top of. If you understand
linear algebra, you can understand how what are the formulas behind
stochastic gradient descent. If you understand those formulas, then you
can understand how neural networks reduce error with each pass and
improve their predictions. And so on and so forth.</p>
<p>Let's say you have found your interest, you have a foundation of
knowledge, and you're keen to work on something big. The next step is
knowing what to work on. What do you value and what type of people you
wanna be surrounded by.</p>
<p>Paul Graham says that to do great work, you need to 1) have a deep
interest in the area and a natural aptitude, 2) put in the amount of
work required, 3) the area needs to have a scope for greatness.</p>
<p>We've tackled number 1 before.</p>
<p>The next step is putting in the amount of work required. While some
people may argue you can work 35 hours a week and be productive. More
hours still equals more hours, albeit at a lower productivity. If
someone works 35 hours, and another person works 60 hours, the person
who works 60 hours will have produced more results.</p>
<p>It doesn't mean that you're going to work until exhaustion. Research
shows you need to let your mind wander after working for a few hours. It
helps build connections between your ideas and frankly it keeps you
healthy and active for the long run. It does mean that when you're done
working, you can go for a walk, do a differnet activity, but when you
feel like you have another idea or a way to keep going in your work. You
go back to it. Whether that is after dinner, in the morning, or during
the lunch break.</p>
<p>If you're interested in it, it won't feel like work. You will have an
urge to finish this task. Almost when a writer sets up a plot at the
beginning of a novel you need to resolve.</p>
<p>It also doesn't mean that this area needs to be work you're getting
paid to do on your normal hours. You can work your 9 to 5, or less. And
in your off-time put in the additional time in personal projects or
reading books. In fact, it is often times better to do it for yourself.
It is better to solve a problem for a sample of 1 than to solve it for a
fictitious refined customer.</p>
<p>The third point, is the area needs to have a scope for greatness.
Frankly, I'm still exploring what this means for me. The area needs to
have a scope for greatness.</p>
<p>In my experience, greatness is abstract. It depends on what your
philosophy of life is. Do you care about animal welfare, climate change,
healthcare costs? That'd be the first area to think about.</p>
<p>Within that realm, not all projects in climate change area made the
same. You can either work in a large team, in a big company. Or you can
work in a smaller team, where your output is visible and you know who
your customer is.</p>
<p>Johny Ive, one of the great apple designers, says early in your
career it is best to work in fast-paced start-ups with &lt;100 people
solving important problems.</p>
<p>You can also tell when your work has scope for greatness at a gut
level. In one of my consulting projects we were cutting costs for a
hospital by analyzing how many printers they needed. That was brutal. In
my current company, I'm building the data infrastructure to show
customers cheaper drug prices. In one project, my work was going to be a
presentation where it may or may not have been implemented. In the other
we were actively serving customers who were going to benefit from me
adding an extra discount card for their prescription medicine.</p>
<p>Decide you want to do great work. Explore your interests. Define what
kind of work within that interest has scope for greatness. Then pursue
it.</p>
