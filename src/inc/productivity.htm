<h2>Compiled thoughts on productivity</h2>
<p>&quot;Small compounds in productivity can have a large impact in your long-term career&quot;</p>
<h3>Sam Altman</h3>
<p>If you're not feeling productive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your task might not be clear</li>
<li>Your project might not be defined</li>
<li>You might not want to work on it</li>
<li>It might not be connected to your values (or you don't see the clear connection)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most important beliefs is that you can learn whatever you want; and that you can improve quickly.</p>
<p>Three key pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to get the important shit done</li>
<li>Dont waste time on stupid shit</li>
<li>Make lots of lists</li>
</ul>
<p>Most meetings should be 15-20 min or 2 hours.</p>
<p>Don't fall in productivity porn, it's more important to work on the right things than to work efficiently on the wrong things. Focus on the year not the day.</p>
<p>Have great sleep: quiet, dark, cold room.</p>
<p>Invest in good monitors, beautiful desk.</p>
<p>Don't neglet friends and family for the sake of productivity. Stupid trade-off.</p>
<p>Think more about what to work on.</p>
