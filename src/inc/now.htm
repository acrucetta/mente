<h2 id="what-im-up-to-now">What I’m up to now</h2>
<p><strong>Things I’m learning</strong> - Algorithms &amp; Data
Structures (notes: {algorithms}) - How to use Linux and set-up
applications with Kubernetes (notes: {devops})</p>
<p><strong>Questions I’m focused on</strong> - How do virtual machines
compile language? - How do ML domain accelerators work? - How can I
deploy my own website on a remote server? - How can we use Kubernetes to
handle ML deployments?</p>
<p><strong>Problems I’m interested in</strong> - What does it mean to
transition to cleaner energy? - What kind of policies are more
effective? - What type of data do we need to harness to track emissions
more effectively? - How can you make healthcare more accessible and
affordable - What makes some societies follow the rule of law vs. not
(e.g., Venezuela vs. U.S.) - What can emerging countries to do go from
oil-driven economies to technology driven? - Do we really need more
people coding or what other jobs are actually needed most? - What makes
successful companies? What makes a culture that promotes innovation
vs. one that stiffens it</p>
