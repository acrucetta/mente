not lacking creativity, you are overwhelmed</a></p>
<p>Creativity is composed of curation, ideation, creation, and
distribution. There is no creation without inspiration. Without
curation, there is no creation. Intention is key in curation.</p>
<p>Curation is the art of selection. It's the filtering through the
information we are exposed to and choosing what deserves our attention.
A way to capture content is using the CODE framework:</p>
<ul>
<li>Capture - keep what resonates</li>
<li>Organize - save for actionability</li>
<li>Distill - find the essence</li>
<li>Express - show your work</li>
</ul>
