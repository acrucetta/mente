not lacking creativity, you are overwhelmed</a></p>
<p>Creativity is composed of curation, ideation, creation, and
distribution. There is no creation without inspiration. Without
curation, there is no creation. Intention is key in curation.</p>
<p>Curation is the art of selection. It’s the filtering through the
information we are exposed to and choosing what deserves our attention.
A way to capture content is using the CODE framework: - Capture - keep
what resonates - Organize - save for actionability - Distill - find the
essence - Express - show your work</p>
