<h2>Notes on Innovation</h2>
<p><strong>Source</strong>: Steven Johnson on Where Good Ideas Come
From</p>
<p>Innovation doesn't come from bright ideas from a single human being.
They come from "ideas having sex" and creating new solutions.</p>
<p>Ideas happen in highly concentrated environments. Where people can
experience issues, connect their ideas with other people and find new
alternatives.</p>
<p>Once humans moved to dense environments the amount of innovation
increased. We invented farming, leading to factories, leading to modern
cities.</p>
<p>Innovation comes from the "adjacent possible", when an idea occurs at
the right time. When the resources to make the idea possible are
available.</p>
<p>E.g., when Charles Babbage created the first computer we didn't have
transistors or vacuum tubes to create the first circuits. It would have
taken years to assemble his "thinking machine".</p>
