<h2>Notes on Software Architecture</h2>
<h3>Game Programming Patterns</h3>
<p>Good architecture takes real effort and discipline. Every time you
make a change or implement a feature, you have to work hard to integrate
it gracefully into the rest of the program. You have to take great care
to both organize the code well and keep it organized throughout the
thousands of little changes that make up a development cycle.</p>
<p>The second half of this — maintaining your design — deserves special
attention. I’ve seen many programs start out beautifully and then die a
death of a thousand cuts as programmers add “just one tiny little hack”
over and over again.</p>
<p>Like gardening, it’s not enough to put in new plants. You must also
weed and prune.</p>
<p>“Writing well-architected code takes careful thought, and that
translates to time. Moreso, maintaining a good architecture over the
life of a project takes a lot of effort. You have to treat your codebase
like a good camper does their campsite: always try to leave it a little
better than you found it.”</p>
