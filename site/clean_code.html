<p><strong>Reduce cognitive load by making your code
simpler.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Limit the amount of code in a function or file. Keep functions small
and limit each class to a single responsibility.</li>
<li>Simplify control flow. Functions with too many if statements or
loops can be hard to understand since it is difficult to keep the entire
control flow in your head. Hide complex logic in helper functions, and
reduce nesting by using early returns to handle special cases.</li>
<li>Minimize mutable state. Stateless code is simpler to understand. For
example, avoid mutable class fields when possible, and make types
immutable.</li>
<li>Include only relevant details in test. Don't use boilerplate test
data that is irrelevant</li>
<li>Don't overuse mocks in tests. Too many mocks can clutter calls and
expose implementation details of the system under test.</li>
</ul>

novice programmer</a></p>
<p>It's important to remove as much friction as possible from your basic
process. Otherwise it's like trying to cook with dull knives and rusty
pots, except worse because it interrupts your train of thought. You
can't do good work with bad tools.</p>
<p>When you start the next project, start it in VScode in the beginning.
And maybe set aside an hour or two before you start in earnest, just to
go through the VSCode tutorial and familiarize yourself with its basic
features, without trying to do that at the same time you are actually
thinking about your homework. This will pay off quickly.</p>
<p>Don't cut corners writing code:</p>
<ul>
<li>It's tempting to use the first variable of a function instead of
building a suggestive one. But remembering imposes a tiny cost every
time you do it. These tiny costs seem insignificant. But they
compound.</li>
<li>Optimize your code for quick and easy reading, at the cost of slower
and more careful writing</li>
<li>Use interfaces when abstracting code. When you add a method and then
call it from different places you advance the program by extending the
number of operations it can do without you thinking of them</li>
<li>If something is messy, it might be tempting to imagine it doesn't
matter. It does matter. The costs are small but compound. Invest in
cleaning up messy code. Otherwise it will get worse over time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Debugging is a science. Always have a clear mind of what question are
you trying to answer. Before you debug think <em>What do I think will
happen in this breakpoint?</em></p>
<p>Use the finger of blame. What part of the code is really responsible
for the problem. Until you find the smoking gun.</p>
