novice programmer</a></p>
<p>It’s important to remove as much friction as possible from your basic
process. Otherwise it’s like trying to cook with dull knives and rusty
pots, except worse because it interrupts your train of thought. You
can’t do good work with bad tools.</p>
<p>When you start the next project, start it in VScode in the beginning.
And maybe set aside an hour or two before you start in earnest, just to
go through the VSCode tutorial and familiarize yourself with its basic
features, without trying to do that at the same time you are actually
thinking about your homework. This will pay off quickly.</p>
<p>Don’t cut corners writing code: - It’s tempting to use the first
variable of a function instead of building a suggestive one. But
remembering imposes a tiny cost every time you do it. These tiny costs
seem insignificant. But they compound. - Optimize your code for quick
and easy reading, at the cost of slower and more careful writing - Use
interfaces when abstracting code. When you add a method and then call it
from different places you advance the program by extending the number of
operations it can do without you thinking of them - If something is
messy, it might be tempting to imagine it doesn’t matter. It does
matter. The costs are small but compound. Invest in cleaning up messy
code. Otherwise it will get worse over time.</p>
<p>Debugging is a science. Always have a clear mind of what question are
you trying to answer. Before you debug think <em>What do I think will
happen in this breakpoint?</em></p>
<p>Use the finger of blame. What part of the code is really responsible
for the problem. Until you find the smoking gun.</p>
