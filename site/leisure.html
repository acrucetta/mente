<h2>Notes on Leisure</h2>
<p>Source: <a

on Leisure</a></p>
<p>In Ancient Greece, explains Aeon, most of the labour was outsourced
to slaves, while wealthier parts of society pursued other activities.
“Leisure was an <strong>active state of mind</strong>. Good leisure
meant playing sports, learning music theory, debating qualified peers
and doing philosophy. Leisure was not easy, but it was supposed to be
gratifying.”</p>
<p>Keinan believes social media exacerbates our focus on productive
leisure. Referencing a 2021 research paper, she suggests people are
pivoting to signal their status and accomplishments in alternative
domains – in this case, the use of their free time.</p>
<p>Some try to ‘hack’ leisure by applying productivity techniques, says
Aeon, like listening to a podcast while jogging or watching Netflix
shows at twice the regular speed.</p>
<p>Part of the problem, new research shows, is how comprehensively we
internalise the message that leisure is wasteful. Selin A Malkoc,
associate professor of marketing at the Fisher College of Business at
The Ohio State University and co-author of the study, says certain
people perceive leisure as lacking value, even when it doesn’t interfere
with their pursuit of goals.</p>

doesn’t interfere with their pursuit of goals</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Types of leisure:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Terminal leisure: activity and the goal are 'fused' together. The
activity is immediately rewarding and an end goal in itself</li>
<li>Instrumental leisure: taking a child trick-or-treating to check-off
parental duties</li>
</ul>
<p>Keinan says a way to reduce the pressure of not enjoying leisure is
by “assuming a broader perspective on life and anticipating your
long-term regrets, as it allows people to enjoy the present more”.</p>
<p>He (Keinan) recommends using mindfulness to help savour leisure
experiences. “It expands your subjective perception of time (i.e., you
feel like you have more of it) and enhances memory formation, which
means you’ll not only feel like your vacations lasted longer, but you’ll
remember them a lot better.”</p>
<p>“If you approach a vacation with a ‘should’ mindset, you might be
messing it up,” warns Malkoc. “Don’t let your belief that you ‘need to
get the best out of this’ get the best of you.”</p>
