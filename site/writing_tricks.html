<h2>Notes on Writing Tricks</h2>
<h3>Write different versions of the blog post (Jason Friedman)</h3>
<p>During Q&amp;A at a conference I spoke at a few years back, someone
asked me “What’s your take on the true value of a university education?”
I shared my general opinion (summary: great socially, but not realistic
enough academically) and ended with a description of a course I’d like
to see taught in college. In fact, I’d like to teach it.</p>
<p>It would be a writing course. Every assignment would be delivered in
five versions: A three page version, a one page version, a three
paragraph version, a one paragraph version, and a one sentence
version.</p>
<p>I care about the constant refinement and compression. I care about
taking three pages and turning it one page. Then from one page into
three paragraphs. Then from three paragraphs into one paragraph. And
finally, from one paragraph into one perfectly distilled sentence.</p>
<p>Each step requires asking “What’s really important?” That’s the most
important question you can ask yourself about anything</p>
