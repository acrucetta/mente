<ul>
<li>Attention is a gift: <em>attention is a moral act. It creates,
brings aspects of things into being.</em> A person who radiates warmth
will bring out the glowing side of people he meets.</li>
<li>Be a loud listener: when the other person is talking, listen so
actively you are burning calories. Respond with “aha”, “yes” or even
“amen”</li>
<li>Storify whenever possible: don’t ask what do you think about X? ask
how did you come to believe X?</li>
<li>Do the looping, especially with adolescents: paraphrase what other
people are telling you</li>
<li>Turn your partner into a narrator: ask more details about people’s
stories</li>
<li>Don’t be a topper: if somebody tells you they’re having troubles
with his teenager, don’t turn around and say, “I know exactly what you
mean, this things also happened to me and it’s worst”</li>
</ul>

<p><em>The quality of your conversation will depend on the quality of
your questions - David Brooks</em></p>
<p>As adults we get inhibited with our questions. People are dying to
tell you their stories. Very often, no one has ever asked about
them.</p>
