<h2>Notes on productivity</h2>
<p>"Small compounds in productivity can have a large impact in your
long-term career"</p>
<h3>From Balaji Srinivasan</h3>
<p><strong>How to focus</strong></p>
<p>Doing more than one thing is very hard. You can do one big thing, and
you can attach lots of subroutines to that. But if you’re trying to do
more than one big thing, you have to decide every single moment of the
day, am I spending time on A or B?</p>
<p>I lie awake at night and think, Okay, here’s what I’ve learned today.
How does that fit into my broad collection of ideas? Where are the
contradictions, overlaps, and so on?</p>
<p>Your email inbox is a to-do list other people write for you. Task
length and importance are not related to recently received.</p>
<p>What you choose to load into your brain first thing in the morn- ing
is the most precious, precious space. Perhaps your first few hours
should be offline with pen and paper, writing things out. Some offline
time is good, so you don’t just immediately jack into the internet</p>
<p>I write a lot of stuff longhand because it forces focus. There are
zero interruptions. Later in the day, I take those pieces of paper, a
draft of a book chapter or something, and type it in a digital file.</p>
<p>Drive your work forward before the rest of the world rushes in. You
know it’s going to rush in, but you want to hold it back and drive your
focus forward as much as you can, and then let the water of the day rush
in.</p>

<p>I want to maximize the total number of hours I can work, including
weekdays and weekends. I might want to work for sixteen hours one day,
then rest the next day. I do meetings only one day a week. The rest of
the week, I am totally free to work spontaneously. That’s my single
biggest productivity hack: stack all meetings on (for example) Monday
and Thurs- day. Then you are always no more than three days from a
meeting, yet you get five focus days per week.</p>
<p><strong>What to learn</strong></p>
<p>The newest technical papers and the oldest books are the best sources
of arbitrage. They contain the least popular facts and the most
monetizable truths.</p>
<p>Technical journals and old books are what I read with intent, as
opposed to tech news, which I get in my peripheral vision.</p>
<p><strong>How to learn</strong></p>
<p>To learn technical content fast, I just start doing problems. I don’t
even read the text until I get stuck on a problem. Espe- cially in
technical topics, if you know foundations (differential equations,
statistics, or Maxwell’s equations, for example), you often can start
calculating and see where you hit a roadblock.</p>
<p>it’s easier to try and fail than to go and look up the documentation.
Reading the documentation front to back is much harder before you start
trying. Start, then learn. You have to learn while doing.</p>
<p>You can’t really learn something without using it. One day of
immersion in a new language beats weeks of book learning.</p>
<p>One day of trying to build something with a programming language
beats weeks of theory too. If you talk to people who teach computer
programming, they’ll tell you just “learning to code” is hard.
<strong>You have to learn to do something with code</strong></p>
<p>Learning with intent to use filters down information, and you can
snap things into use immediately. That’s why I think a purpose-driven
life is good. You have a purpose, and you think often about what that
purpose is.</p>
<p>How to understand concepts:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Verbal—explain in words</li>
<li>Visual—make a graph</li>
<li>Algebraic—write the equation</li>
<li>Numerical—do a numerical example</li>
<li>Computational—code a solver or algorithm</li>
<li>Historical—tell where it came from</li>
</ol>
<h3>From Sam Altman</h3>
<p>If you're not feeling productive:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your task might not be clear</li>
<li>Your project might not be defined</li>
<li>You might not want to work on it</li>
<li>It might not be connected to your values (or you don't see the clear
connection)</li>
</ul>
<p>One of the most important beliefs is that you can learn whatever you
want; and that you can improve quickly.</p>
<p>Three key pillars:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure to get the important shit done</li>
<li>Dont waste time on stupid shit</li>
<li>Make lots of lists</li>
</ul>
<p>Most meetings should be 15-20 min or 2 hours.</p>
<p>Don't fall in productivity porn, it's more important to work on the
right things than to work efficiently on the wrong things. Focus on the
year not the day.</p>
<p>Have great sleep: quiet, dark, cold room.</p>
<p>Invest in good monitors, beautiful desk.</p>
<p>Don't neglet friends and family for the sake of productivity. Stupid
trade-off.</p>
<p>Think more about what to work on.</p>
