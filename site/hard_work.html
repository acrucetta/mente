<h2>Notes on Hard Work</h2>
<p>I. Ideal of work</p>
<p>Last year, I changed my mind about work. I believed in strict
work-life balance, working enough to meet our needs and enjoy the rest
of our time. I've now realized that by seeing work as something to
protect or balance against I was stunting the potential of a type of
work you could enjoy and wouldn't mind spending hours on.</p>
<p>The concept of work-life balance alienates work as something to
balance against. As something separate from life. A cruel requirement to
earning a living.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, I'd like work to be closer to Khalil Gibran's
vision in "<a
href="https://www.amazon.com/Audible-The-Prophet/dp/B0BVGLF3D1?crid=2RFFGNDRLVIM6&amp;keywords=the+prophet+kahlil+gibran&amp;qid=1705698259&amp;sprefix=the+prop,aps,110&amp;sr=8-1">The
Prophet</a>":</p>
<p><em>"Work is love made visible. And if you cannot work with love but
only with distaste, it is better that you should leave your work and sit
at the gate of the temple and take alms of those who work with
joy."</em></p>
<p>Work as something that gives us dignity and fulfillment:</p>
<p><em>"And when you work with love, you bind yourself to yourself, and
to one another, and to God."</em></p>
<p><em>"For if you bake bread with indifference, you bake a bitter bread
that feeds but half man's hunger."</em></p>
<p>Although it can take time to get to this point. I think it's a worthy
journey.</p>
<p>II. Finding your work: avoid bullshit first</p>
<p>To find work we enjoy, many of us have to go through many jobs we
like and don't like. From each of them we learn something. There are
jobs that spark your curiosity and others that can be life-draining.</p>
<p>In one of my first jobs, I worked as an analyst for a bank in Utah. I
would have to wake up before 6 am, commute for an hour in the winter,
then sit at my desk filing forms for wealthy people for 10 straight
hours. By the time I left work it was dark again.</p>
<p>My manager would drop a stack of 15 folders on my desk. I'd open each
one, read it, and manually type the information in the bank's
registration website.</p>
<p>Once I was done, I'd go to the printer, print about 500 pages of new
forms, organize them, and head back to my desk. My second day at the job
one of the interns cried near the printer station lamenting she had to
sit idle at the printer for hours each day.</p>
<p>This experience taught me there's a whole category of jobs where your
tasks can feel meaningless. Where you know at your core that the job
could be automated or just exists to check a box.</p>
<p>David Graeber in his book "<a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bullshit_Jobs">Bullshit Jobs</a>"
talks about these types of jobs.</p>
<p><em>"A bullshit job is a form of paid employment that is so
completely pointless, unnecessary, or pernicious that even the employee
cannot justify its existence even though, as part of the conditions of
employment, the employee feels obliged to pretend that this is not the
case."</em></p>
<p><em>"Huge swathes of people spend their days performing jobs they
secretly believe do not really need to be performed."</em></p>
<p><em>"The moral and spiritual damage that comes from this situation is
profound. It is a scar across our collective soul. Yet virtually no one
talks about it."</em></p>
<p>We could argue that opening accounts for trust funds has a use and
it's not a bullshit job. However, since we worked with paper forms that
we know could be automated, it put it back in the "bullshit job"
category.</p>
<p>We were a buffer between the registration site and wealthy
individuals that didn't want to fill up forms online. The bank didn't
want to force them either.</p>
<p>A survey from the UK said about 37% of British workers claimed their
job "didn't make a meaningful contribution to the world". [add
citation]</p>
<p>Reading through the book I found my past job nailed a few of the
Bullshit Job:</p>
<ul>
<li>[] Do you believe that if your job didn't exist, it wouldn't make
any difference to society or anyone's well-being?</li>
<li>[] Are many of your tasks or responsibilities contrived to keep you
busy, rather than to accomplish something practical or beneficial?</li>
<li>[] Do you spend a significant portion of your time on paperwork,
meetings, or administrative tasks that seem to have little overall
effect?</li>
<li>[] Does your job involve solving problems that shouldn't exist or
could be easily avoided?</li>
</ul>
<p>III. Finding your work: try out things</p>
<p>Once you've decided you want to work on something that's meaningful
to you, its important to try out a lot things. Specially early in your
career.</p>
<p>Paul Graham in his essay "<a
href="https://www.paulgraham.com/greatwork.html">How to do Great
Work</a>" explained how to the way to know what to work on is by
working. You're going to guess wrong many times and that will teach you
what jobs you enjoy or not.</p>
<p><em>If you don't know what to work on; take chance meetings, make
yourself a big target for luck. Try lots of things, meet people, read
books, ask questions - Paul Graham</em></p>
<p>To find out I enjoyed programming I worked as a CAD designer, a
business development intern for an oil company, an operations analyst
for a bank, and as a management consultant for healthcare companies.</p>
<p>Each of those experiences were early in my career, and while some
were better than others they all gave me hints where I felt most
engaged.</p>
<p>Some jobs I did to seek approval from my parents, others I chased for
prestige and the allure of travel. Neither of these things fulfilled
me.</p>
<p>Paul Graham's essay warned in his essay of <em>"pretentiousness,
fashion, fear, money, politics, other people's wishes, and eminent
frauds. Stick to what you find interesting"</em></p>
<p>I found out that to avoid these traps you need to spend the time
asking yourself if you're engaged in your job. A sign that you're in the
right field is that it becomes increasingly interesting to you as you
learn more about it.</p>
<p>In academic environments, specially in graduate schools (i.e., MBA)
it's easy to fall into <em>memetic thinking</em> [add citation], that is
wishing what others want. Wanting to be in a big tech company, or in top
consulting firm, or in a hot start-up.</p>
<p>While those are commonly good avenues for people to develop on, they
can be fraught with people resenting it's not what they thought it would
be.</p>
<p>Once you tried a few things, and found out a field that's become
increasingly interesting with time. The next step is to focus.</p>
<p>IV. Exploiting your interest, focus</p>
<p>Focusing can be exponential. If you're focused on 4 things, moving to
3 can be a 20% jump in productivity. But if you move to 1 it can be a
400% jump.</p>
<p><em>Almost everyone I’ve ever met would be well-served by spending
more time thinking about what to focus on. It is much more important to
work on the right thing than it is to work many hours. Most people waste
most of their time on stuff that doesn’t matter. - Sam Altman</em></p>
<p><em>I’ve learned that I can’t be very productive working on things I
don’t care about or don’t like - Sam Altman</em></p>
<p><em>Don't divide your attention too thinly; be professionally curious
about a few topics and idly curious about many more. - Paul
Graham</em></p>
<p>Focusing is more about picking what to work on vs. finding out what
note taking tool will give you an edge in organizing your information.
It's useless to spend time finding out how to do something productive
that shouldn't have been done in the first place.</p>
<p>I've fallen trap to this many times, I've spent hours figuring out
how to organize a project in Notion, or browsing reddit forums figuring
out what's the best book for a subject. Instead of opening a book that's
<em>good enough</em> and getting started working.</p>
<p>I've come to realize that it doesn't matter which tools you use, it
does matter that you pick the project you want to work on carefully and
saying no to distractions along the way.</p>
<p>V. Learn about the field</p>
<p><img
src="https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1272,c_limit,f_webp,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F8b2211f4-2314-4838-b5c0-f1a7af9738f1_908x661.png"
alt="Layers of Knowledge" /></p>
<p>In order to be successful in a field you need to have a strong
foundation where you can layer new knowledge.</p>
<p>In a Haruki Murakami’s Norwegian Wood passage Nagasawa tells the
book’s protagonist, Toru Watanabe, that he only reads books whose
authors have been dead for at least thirty years.</p>
<p>He continues saying <em>"If you only read the books that everyone
else is reading, you can only think what everyone else is
thinking"</em></p>
<p>How to build foundational knowledge? Ask yourself, what are the
concepts in my field that are not going to change in the next 5-10
years.</p>
<p>In computer science, it means knowing about algorithms, data
structures, computer networking, or how operating systems work.</p>
<p>There might be many trends of Generative AI models, but they will all
have to be run on computers, use networking to communicate with each
other, and apply linear algebra to predict the results.</p>
<p><em>“I very frequently get the question: 'What's going to change in
the next 10 years?' And that is a very interesting question; it's a very
common one. I almost never get the question: 'What's not going to change
in the next 10 years?' And I submit to you that that second question is
actually the more important of the two -- because you can build a
business strategy around the things that are stable in time. - Jeff
Bezos</em></p>
<p>V. Doing meaningful work</p>
<p>Assuming you've found an area that interests you, and learned enough
to be useful to any company. The last step is doing great work.</p>
<p>Many times it's hard to figure out if what you're doing is going to
make a difference. Finding what to work on is a combination of luck and
persistence.</p>
<p>In his talk, <a
href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmYekD6-PZ8">Running Down a
Dream</a>, Bill Gurley talked about a young musician named Robert
Zimmerman who shows this idea.</p>
<p><em>‌Robert loved music, and in this early photo he’s got a drum. He
got a guitar when he was 10 years old, and by high school was playing in
a band regularly. They used to cover Elvis and Little Richard. His
yearbook says that he’s likely to join Little Richard.</em></p>
<p><em>He didn’t have a lot of money. Back in the time you could walk
into a record store and listen in a booth. He would do that for hours
and hours and hours. He became friends with people that also liked folk
music, but had money. He would go to their house and listen to their
record collection.</em></p>
<p><em>The next thing that happened, I think, is one of the most
ambitious actions anyone that I know has taken to pursue their dream
job. He hitch-hiked from Minneapolis to New York City. He had a guitar,
a suitcase and $10, and it’s 1,200 miles. If you ask him today why he
did it, he’ll talk a little bit about chasing the performers, so this is
Dave Van Ronk, Peggy Seeger, the New Lost City Ramblers, these were
people he was listening to in Minnesota, but these people were in New
York City, and so he wanted to see them.</em></p>
<p><em>He went to New York. He found Woody Guthrie. He used to perform
for him. Then he started hanging out at these three venues, the Café
Wha?, The Gaslight Café and Gerde’s Folk City. This was the epicenter of
folk music at the time, and he would sit in each of these venues for
hours upon hours and study what the other artists were doing.</em></p>
<p><em>He was studying, studying, studying. He got a big break. He was
asked to open for John Lee Hooker at Gerde’s one day, and his career got
started.</em></p>
<p><em>This gentleman is Joe Hammond. He was the producer for Aretha
Franklin, Billie Holiday, Count Basie. One day he walked in and found
this gentleman, 1961. I think he’s 22, 23, something like that. The next
year Robert Zimmerman changes his name to Bob Dylan.</em></p>
<p>We may have to try out different things to find out what we like. But
when we do, we owe it to ourselves to care about it. To learn, focus,
and share our work with others.</p>
