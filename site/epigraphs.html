<h3 id="useful-sayings">Useful sayings</h3>
<p>I think of strength training as a form of retirement saving. Just as
we want to retire with enough money saved up to sustain us for the rest
of our lives, we want to reach an older age with enough of a “reserve”
of muscle and bone density to protect us from injury and allow us to
pursue the activities that we enjoy</p>
<p>Help people not because they will help you back, but because you are
able to help them</p>
<p>Choose beliefs that are useful, even if they’re not true;
e.g. imagine a pot of gold or a tiger behind you when running</p>
<p>Find your community orchestra, where can you do things with other
people that matter, that bring joy and happiness to others, or connect
you with nature</p>
<p>Talk to an acquaintance in my industry at least once a week, remember
the power of weak ties</p>
<p>If you do something scary today, you’ll be creative and inspired. You
will find new solutions tomorrow. If you don’t, then you will be exactly
the same.</p>
<p>Don’t be the best, be the only - Kevin Kelly</p>
<p>Don’t worry about making things useful all the time, dare to make
art, useless art - Derek Sivers</p>
<p>“To a disciple who was forever complaining about others, the Master
said, ‘If it is peace you want, seek to change yourself, not other
people. It is easier to protect your feet with slippers than to carpet
the whole of the earth.’” — Anthony de Mello</p>
<p>It is easy to complain. Any idiot can highlight a problem. It is not
easy to brainstorm, to learn, and to find solutions - Arnold
Schwarzenegger</p>
<p>When you do a lot of practice, try to learn a bit of theory, when you
do too much theory, try to do a bit of practice</p>
<p>My teacher offered this ingenious tactic: Don’t tell yourself you’ll
practice thirty minutes everyday. This will fail. Instead, pick the
shakuhachi up and just hold it. Of course, if you’ve already picked it
up, you may as well play a bit, right?</p>
<p>Action begets inspiration; once I start working on something I become
inspired to learn more about it. When working on a project, seek to
invest 20-30 min on it and see what parts I enjoy, do more of those</p>
<p>The quality of the recipe is as good as the quality of the
ingredients and how you treat them - Danny Meyer</p>
<p>And as the authors of “Crucial Conversations” observe, in any
conversation, respect is like air. When it’s present nobody notices it,
and when it’s absent it’s all anybody can think about.</p>
<p>“Practical men, who believe themselves to be quite exempt from any
intellectual influences, are usually the slaves of some defunct
economist.” - John Maynard Keynes</p>
<p>Hard work is a competitive advantage. Even the belief that hard work
is a competitive advantage is itself now a competitive advantage. -
Balaji Srinivasan</p>
<p>When you take the time to sit alone with your thoughts, you can find
who you want to be; not who your parents want you to be, not who your
friends want you to be, and definitely not who some shyster on Instagram
or TikTok wants you to be. - Arnold S.</p>
<p>Choosing to be nice is strength. Feeling compelled to always be nice
is weakness. Choosing when to be disagreeable, when required, is
strength. Always being disagreeable is weakness. - Mark Manson</p>
