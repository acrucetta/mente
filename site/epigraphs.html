<h2>Epigrams</h2>
<h3>Useful sayings</h3>
<p><em>I think of strength training as a form of retirement saving. Just as we want to retire with enough money saved up to sustain us for the rest of our lives, we want to reach an older age with enough of a “reserve” of muscle and bone density to protect us from injury and allow us to pursue the activities that we enjoy</em> </p>
<p><em>Help people not because they will help you back, but because are able to help them</em></p>
<p><em>Choose beliefs that are useful, even if they're not true; e.g. imagine a pot of gold or a tiger behind you when running</em></p>
<p><em>Find your community orchestra, where can you do things with other people that matter, that bring joy and happiness to others, or connect you with nature</em></p>
<p><em>Talk to an acquaintance in my industry at least once a week, remember the power of weak ties</em></p>
<p><em>If you do something scary today, you'll be creative and inspired. You will find new solutions tomorrow. If you don't, then you will be exactly the same.</em></p>
<p><em>Don't be the best, be the only - Kevin Kelly</em></p>
<p><em>Don't worry about making things useful all the time, dare to make art, useless art - Derek Sivers</em></p>
<p><em>“To a disciple who was forever complaining about others, the Master said, ‘If it is peace you want, seek to change yourself, not other people. It is easier to protect your feet with slippers than to carpet the whole of the earth.’” — Anthony de Mello</em></p>
<p><em>It is easy to complain. Any idiot can highlight a problem. It is not easy to brainstorm, to learn, and to find solutions - Arnold Schwarzenegger</em></p>
<p><em>When you do a lot of practice, try to learn a bit of theory, when you do too much theory, try to do a bit of practice</em></p>
<p><em>My teacher offered this ingenious tactic:</em>
<em>Don't tell yourself you'll practice thirty minutes everyday. This will fail. Instead, pick the shakuhachi up and just hold it.</em>
<em>Of course, if you've already picked it up, you may as well play a bit, right?</em></p>
<p><em>Action begets inspiration; once I start working on something I become inspired to learn more about it. When working on a project, seek to invest 20-30 min on it and see what parts I enjoy, do more of those</em></p>
<p><em>The quality of the recipe is as good as the quality of the ingredients and how you treat them - Danny Meyer</em></p>
