<h2>Notes on Learning</h2>
<h3>Quotes</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>We remember 10% of what we read, 20% of what we listen to, and 70% of
what we act upon</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To learn something new, I would spend 80% of my time doing and 20%
reading theory.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>We do not learn from experience; we learn from reflecting on
experiences.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Reading a book without taking notes is like discovering a new
territory without ddrawing a map.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>"You don’t sharpen your skills with resources, books, or articles.
You sharpen your skills with practice. If you want to get better, go do
the thingA</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>To teach distill what you know. Develop the theory of what you
learned by instinct and practice. By teaching you will understand your
craft better than you did before. By giving away your techniques you
will empower peers and competitors. Force yourself to stay creative and
continuously open new doors.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Lex Fridman on Acquiring Skills</h3>
<p>"The way to remove motivation out of the picture is to build a
habit"</p>
<p>Be a stickler to spend at least 1h a day learning what you want to
specialize on; at least for the first 1 to 2 years</p>
<p>Build discipline so you don't have to rely on motivation; even 1
minute over time makes a huge difference</p>
<p>Anyone can become an expert on something if you spend enough time
focused on it</p>
<p>"Passion and motivation are momentary; you have to rely on habit"</p>
<h3>Theory of Learning</h3>
<p>Teaching facilitates learning; learning comes from practice. Practice
comes from passion and excitement. Passion and excitement come from
trying out things. To know what things to try out, surround yourself by
ideas and content every day.</p>
<h3>The Talent Code (Strategies for Learning)</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Have in your mind the top performers of your field at all times</li>
<li>Steal ideas from people you admire</li>
<li>Always be writing inspiration and ideas; use notebooks to prevent
yourself from being distracted; use them as a way to reflect</li>
</ol>
