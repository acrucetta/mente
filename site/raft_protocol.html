<h1>raft_protocol.htm</h1>
<p>Overview</p>
<ul>
<li>Raft is a protocol for implementing distributed consensus.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Components</h3>
<p>Leader Election</p>
<ul>
<li>All nodes start as followers, they can become candidates or leaders
over time</li>
<li>The candidate becomes the majority if it receives most of the
votes</li>
<li>Each node has an <em>election timeout</em> (150-300ms), after a
certain time it asks other nodes for a vote. If the node hasn't voted it
will vote for the requesting node</li>
<li>To commit an entry, the node replicates the value to the
followers</li>
<li>Messages are sent across nodes in "heartbeat timeouts"</li>
</ul>
<p>Log Replication</p>
<ul>
<li>The leader receives a message</li>
<li>Then it sends it to the other nodes via a "heartbeat"</li>
<li>Once it receives the reply back, it sends back an acknowledge
message to the client</li>
</ul>
<p>Network issues</p>
<ul>
<li>Raft can sustain network partitions. If the client wants to change a
node, and the partition has a majority, then it succeeds. It will send
the message to the other nodes after.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Algorithm</h2>
<ul>
<li>We first elect a leader; he manages the logs</li>
<li>The leader accepts log entries from clients and replicates it on
servers
<ul>
<li>It also tells them when its safe to apply log entries to their
state</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Sub-problems:</p>
<ul>
<li>How to choose a leader if one fails?</li>
<li>How to replicate the logs?</li>
<li>How to keep the server safe? No commands overlap</li>
</ul>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<ul>
<li>RequestVote RPC</li>
<li>AppendEntries RPC
<ul>
<li>Leaders send this with no log entries to maintain their
authority</li>
<li>If a follower doesn't receive this for a long time it assumes
there's no leader and beings a new election</li>
<li>Used to replicate log entries and form a heartbeat</li>
<li>Servers can retry if they don't receive a response in a timely
manner</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>Elections</h3>
<ul>
<li>Follower increments its current term and becomes a candidate (votes
for itself)</li>
<li>It can either win, lose, or there can be no winner for some
time</li>
<li>A candidate wins with majority vote</li>
<li>Once a candidate wins, it sends heartbeats to maintain its
state</li>
<li>We can have split votes (ties), so we have election timeouts
(150-300 ms) to prevent this</li>
</ul>
<h3>Log Replication</h3>
<ul>
<li>Raft guarantees that:
<ul>
<li>If two entries in diff logs have the same idx and term, they have
the same command</li>
<li>If two entries in diff logs have the same idx and term, the logs are
identical in previos entries</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>State</h3>
<p>Log Entries:</p>
<ul>
<li>Term in which it was created (#)</li>
<li>Command for the state machine</li>
</ul>
<h2>Leader:</h2>
<h2>Peers:</h2>
