<h2>Notes on Manhood</h2>
<h3>From Wild at Heart</h3>
<p>Becoming a man means transcending your false self. Letting go of the image you want to portray to others and aligning your private and public self.
It means having a strong sense of self-worth and competence that comes from having faced challenges, having gone on a journey, come back, and sharing the lessons with others. Having gone on a &quot;Hero's Journey&quot;.</p>
<p>It means not considering the woman as the place where you get your sense of self-worth or confidence, but deriving that confidence from your own experiences and trust in your abilities.
It means building a name for yourself. Whether that name is the one assigned to you or the one you respond to. It means knowing your name, knowing your values, what you stand for, what you tolerate and what you don't. </p>
<p><em>If you don't stand for something, you fall for anything</em></p>
<p>To create that renewed image you have to challenge yourself to be initiated. Do something hard. If you're used to being on speech team, trying a contact sport. If you're normally quiet, trying to speak up. It means getting outside of your comfort zone and going through difficulties. So that you know what you're capable of.</p>
<p>It means accepting life difficulties as lessons to learn. </p>
<p>It means recognizing who have been your idols of manhood. Challenging what society teaches you of what it means to be a man. Realizing that the emmasculated, domesticated man is not the person who will survive during a war. There's a reason why aggression has evolved with us. It has done harm and good. Helped us protect our loved ones and our communities.</p>
<p>Being a man means going to the woman to go on an adventure together, not to have her be the center of your life. </p>
