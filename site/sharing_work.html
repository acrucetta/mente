<h2>Notes on Sharing Your Work</h2>
<h3>Meta Learning - Deep Learning</h3>
<p>Speak to your experience. This is one of the most valuable things
that we all have to offer. By showing people what you did and how, as
well as how you felt along the way and what results you achieved, you
draw a map that others can follow and demonstrate what is possible.</p>
<p>You can focus all of your emotional energy on speaking to this one
topic that is currently important to you professionally or that is
something you are attempting to learn.</p>
<p>You can share about yourself as much as you choose, but you do not
have to share anything. In fact, especially in the beginning, and the
more you speak to your experience, the more you speak to the results you
obtain and nothing else, the easier and likely more effective your
online journey will be.</p>
<p>"I will be done with this project when I share it with others."</p>
