<h2>History of Atomic Operations and Locks</h2>
<h3>Key questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Who invented atomic operations?</li>
<li>How does hardware support atomic operations?</li>
</ul>
<h3>Research</h3>
<p>Key Figures and Milestones in the Development of Atomic Operations
Early Mutual Exclusion Concepts:</p>
<p>Edsger Dijkstra: In the 1960s, Dijkstra introduced the concept of
semaphores, which are pivotal in the development of synchronization
mechanisms. Semaphores are a type of synchronization primitive that can
be considered a precursor to atomic operations in ensuring mutual
exclusion. Semaphores: They are a signaling mechanism to control access
to shared resources, crucial in preventing race conditions.
Test-and-Set:</p>
<p>The test-and-set instruction is one of the earliest
hardware-supported atomic operations. It was developed in the 1960s and
1970s. This operation allows a process to test and modify a memory
location in a single, indivisible step. Gary L. Peterson: Known for his
work on Peterson's Algorithm, a software-based mutual exclusion
algorithm that relies on the test-and-set instruction. Compare-and-Swap
(CAS):</p>
<p>Michael J. Fischer and Michael O. Rabin: Their work in the early
1980s led to the development of the compare-and-swap (CAS) operation,
which has become a fundamental building block for many modern lock-free
data structures and algorithms. CAS Operation: It compares the contents
of a memory location to a given value and, only if they match, modifies
the contents to a new value. This atomicity is critical for non-blocking
algorithms.</p>
<p>Transactional Memory: Maurice Herlihy: In the early 1990s, Herlihy's
work on wait-free synchronization and transactional memory has been
influential. His research introduced advanced concepts that furthered
the development of atomic operations. Transactional Memory: Allows
sequences of read and write operations to be executed atomically,
simplifying concurrent programming by abstracting the complexities of
lock management.</p>
