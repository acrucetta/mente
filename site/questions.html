<h1>questions.htm</h1>
<h3 id="questions-ive-liked">questions I’ve liked</h3>
<p>These are some questions I’ve been compiling from different people
over time: - when was the last time you prayed - do you feel better or
worse after spending time with the person you spend the most time with?
- why not travel to your favorite city as often as you can? - what have
you promised to do and not done yet? - have you spent 1 minute today on
your biggest goal? - have you spent 1 hour today on your biggest goal? -
have you spent 10 hours today on your biggest goal? - what’s the most
common advice you give to people? - do you follow it yourself? - does it
need to be said? does it need to be said by me? - is this thought real
or am I tired? - have you read a good history book today? - how am I
being complicit in creating the situation I don’t want for myself? - am
I sleeping well? - when did I last connect with my friends? - am I still
learning for fun? - when was the last time I enjoyed learning something?
- am I getting outside of my comfort zone enough? - is routine actually
helpful all the time? - when was the last time I deviated from my daily
routine - what crossroads are you at? - if the next five years is a
chapter in your life, what is the chapter about? - can you be yourself
where you are and still fit in? - what is your favorite unimportant
thing about you? - what would you do if you weren’t afraid? - if you
died today, what would you regret not doing? - what have you said yes to
that you no longer really believe in? - what talent are you not using? -
how do your ancestors show up in your life?</p>
<p>in difficult times: - What are you trying to teach me here? - What
issues in my heart are you trying to raise through this? - What is it
you want me to see? - What are you asking me to let go of?</p>
