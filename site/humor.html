<h2>Notes on Humor</h2>
<h3>Jerry Seinfield on Humor</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>But the one thing I really do care about communicating to you is
don't lose your humor. Forget the rest. Forget your education, your
degree, your privilege. All of you here would do fantastically well
without any of it. All of you here, without question, are the best of
the best. Just don't lose your, your humor. It's not an accessory. It's
your Stanley Cup water bottle on the brutal long hike of life. And humor
is not just for the stress relief or even just a simple fun of laughing,
but for the true perspective of the silliness of all humans and all
existence. That's why you don't want to lose it. Try to enjoy some of
the dumbness of it all. That's the best life advice I can give you.</p>
