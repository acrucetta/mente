<h2>Principles of Slow Productivity</h2>
<p>The principle of "slow productivity" is that by not being rushed, and
by doing less, we can drive bigger results. When we are rushed and
overwhelmed its hard to be creative and connect ideas.</p>
<h3>1. Do Fewer Things</h3>
<ul>
<li>Have less 'missions'; focus on what are your top 1-2 missions this
year. Focus your time on them
<ul>
<li>For some mathematicians it was proving a specific theorem; they
focused their life around it</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Reduce the amount of ongoing projects
<ul>
<li>For every mission you might have more projects; each project is
going to take your time away</li>
<li>Richard Feynman cultivated an attitude of being "irresponsible" that
is, creating the expectation that he wouldn't respond to people right
away</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don't fall into the shallows of productivity. Set your mind for one
main project for the day and put your focus in it.</li>
</ul>
<h3>2. Work at a natural pace</h3>
<h3>3. Obsess over quality</h3>
