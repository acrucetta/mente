<h2>Notes on working with offshore teams</h2>
<p>Outline: Why you can't oursource your architecture</p>
<ul>
<li><p>I joined a company that had used an offshore team for all its
architecture</p></li>
<li><p>It was taxing to understand the architecture and the decisions;
the documentation was not good</p></li>
<li><p>We decided to redesign the architecture in a way that made
sense</p></li>
<li><p>Slowly we architected the ingestion and transformation using
better tools</p></li>
<li><p>We still engage them but we use templates, async meetings, and
PRs to align everyone remotely</p></li>
<li><p>Offshore teams can be great if you know how to use them: give
some examples</p></li>
<li><p>Things that work</p>
<ul>
<li>Empowering them
<ul>
<li>Including them in discussions</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Making them part of your team</li>
<li>Guiding their work, having an established review process
<ul>
<li>We didn't have PRs at first since it was all developed offshore</li>
<li>We slowly moved the key archiectural components onshore</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Using tools that allow for PR reviews
<ul>
<li>e.g. avoiding stored procedures going to DBT</li>
<li>e.g., using ADF without version control at some point</li>
<li>Helps to avoid blaming others for issues and pointing fingers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Establishing templates for key parts of the work you want to review
<ul>
<li>PR templates</li>
<li>Pipeline and code templates</li>
<li>Python code templates</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Setting up cadences to review code during major releases
<ul>
<li>Review major engineering decisions together</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Communicate async and delegate work overnight
<ul>
<li>Taking advantage of the one perk of working with offshore teams</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Decide what kind of work is better done offshore vs. onshore
<ul>
<li>e.g., high interaction with business teams is sometimes better
onshore</li>
<li>e.g., routine processes like new ingestion pipelines can be better
offshore</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Know who does what offshore and get to know them one on one
<ul>
<li>Evaluate the quality of the work and set expectations</li>
<li>Sometimes if its a staffing company they can replace people</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Things that don't work</p>
<ul>
<li>Delegating architecture to their team</li>
<li>Leaving key parts of your skills or technology away</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
