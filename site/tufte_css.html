<p>Tufte CSS provides tools to style web articles using the ideas
demonstrated by Edward Tufte's books and handouts. Tufte's style is
known for its simplicity, extensive use of sidenotes, tight integration
of graphics with text, and carefully chosen typography.</p>
<p>Tufte CSS was created by <a href="http://www.daveliepmann.com">Dave
Liepmann</a> and is now an Edward Tufte project. The original idea was
cribbed from <a
href="https://tufte-latex.github.io/tufte-latex/">Tufte-<span class="latex">L<span class="latex-sup">a</span>T<span
class="latex-sub">e</span>X</span></a> and <a
href="http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/tufte_handout_format.html">R
Markdown's Tufte Handout format</a>. We give hearty thanks to all the
people who have contributed to those projects.</p>
<p>If you see anything that Tufte CSS could improve, we welcome your
contribution in the form of an issue or pull request on the GitHub
project: <a
href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css">tufte-css</a>. Please
note the <a
href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/tufte-css#contributing">contribution
guidelines</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, a reminder about the goal of this project. The web is not
print. Webpages are not books. Therefore, the goal of Tufte CSS is not
to say "websites should look like this interpretation of Tufte's books"
but rather "here are some techniques Tufte developed that we've found
useful in print; maybe you can find a way to make them useful on the
web". Tufte CSS is merely a sketch of one way to implement this
particular set of ideas. It should be a starting point, not a design
goal, because any project should present their information as best suits
their particular circumstances.</p>
</section>

<h2>Getting Started</h2>
<p>To use Tufte CSS, copy <code>tufte.css</code> and the
<code>et-book</code> directory of font files to your project directory,
then add the following to your HTML document's <code>head</code>
block:</p>
<pre><code>&lt;link rel=&quot;stylesheet&quot; href=&quot;tufte.css&quot;/&gt;</code></pre>
<p>Now you just have to use the provided CSS rules, and the Tufte CSS
conventions described in this document. For best results, View Source
and Inspect Element frequently.</p>
<h2>Fundamentals</h2>
<h3>Sections and Headings</h3>
<p>Organize your document with an <code>article</code> element inside
your <code>body</code> tag. Inside that, use <code>section</code> tags
around each logical grouping of text and headings.</p>
<p>Tufte CSS uses <code>h1</code> for the document title, <code>p</code>
with class <code>subtitle</code> for the document subtitle,
<code>h2</code> for section headings, and <code>h3</code> for low-level
headings. More specific headings are not supported. If you feel the urge
to reach for a heading of level 4 or greater, consider redesigning your
document:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>[It is] notable that the Feynman lectures (3 volumes) write about all
of physics in 1800 pages, using only 2 levels of hierarchical headings:
chapters and A-level heads in the text. It also uses the methodology of
<em>sentences</em> which then cumulate sequentially into
<em>paragraphs</em>, rather than the grunts of bullet points.
Undergraduate Caltech physics is very complicated material, but it
didn't require an elaborate hierarchy to organize.</p>

</blockquote>
<p>As a bonus, this excerpt regarding the use of headings provides an
example of block quotes. In Tufte CSS they are just lightly styled,
semantically correct HTML using <code>blockquote</code> and
<code>footer</code> elements. See page 20 of <a
href="https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi">The Visual Display
of Quantitative Information</a> for an example in print.</p>
<p><span class="newthought">In his later books</span>[^1], Tufte starts
each section with a bit of vertical space, a non-indented paragraph, and
the first few words of the sentence set in small caps. For this we use a
span with the class <code>newthought</code>, as demonstrated at the
beginning of this paragraph. Vertical spacing is accomplished separately
through <code>&lt;section&gt;</code> tags. Be consistent: though we do
so in this paragraph for the purpose of demonstration, do not alternate
use of header elements and the <code>newthought</code> technique. Pick
one approach and stick to it.</p>

Evidence</a></p>
<h3>Text</h3>
<p>Although paper handouts obviously have a pure white background, the
web is better served by the use of slightly off-white and off-black
colors. Tufte CSS uses <code>#fffff8</code> and <code>#111111</code>
because they are nearly indistinguishable from their 'pure' cousins, but
dial down the harsh contrast. We stick to the greyscale for text,
reserving color for specific, careful use in figures and images.</p>
<p>In print, Tufte has used the proprietary Monotype Bembo[^2] font. A
similar effect is achieved in digital formats with the now open-source
<a href="https://github.com/edwardtufte/et-book">ETBook</a>, which Tufte
CSS supplies with a <code>@font-face</code> reference to a .ttf file. In
case ETBook somehow doesn't work, Tufte CSS shifts gracefully to other
serif fonts like Palatino and Georgia.</p>
<p>[^2]: See Tufte's comment in the <a
href="http://www.edwardtufte.com/bboard/q-and-a-fetch-msg?msg_id=0000Vt">Tufte
book fonts</a> thread.</p>
<p>Also notice how Tufte CSS includes separate font files for bold
(strong) and italic (emphasis), instead of relying on the browser to
mechanically transform the text. This is typographic best practice.</p>
<p class="sans">
If you prefer sans-serifs, use the `sans` class. It relies on Gill Sans,
Tufte's sans-serif font of choice.
</p>

<p>Links in Tufte CSS match the body text in color and do not change on
mouseover or when clicked. Here is a <a href="#">dummy example</a> that
goes nowhere. These links are underlined, since this is the most widely
recognized indicator of clickable text. [^blue] However, because most
browsers' default underlining does not clear descenders and is so thick
and distracting, the underline effect is instead achieved using CSS
trickery involving background gradients instead of standard
<code>text-decoration</code>. Credit goes to Adam Schwartz for that
technique.</p>
