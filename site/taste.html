<h2>Notes on Taste</h2>
<p>What is taste?</p>
<p>Taste is a cultivated sensitivity to the nuances and subtleties that
distinguish high-quality work from mediocrity. It's an acquired
understanding of what makes something effective, beautiful, or impactful
within a given domain. Taste develops through a combination of exposure
to a wide range of works, critical analysis, and hands-on experience in
creating.</p>
<p>In writing, taste involves appreciating factors such as structure,
pacing, word choice, and the ability to convey complex ideas with
clarity. In programming, taste encompasses aspects like code
organization, naming conventions, performance optimization, and
adherence to best practices and design patterns.</p>
<p>What does it mean to have taste in creative work?</p>
<p>Having taste in creative work means possessing a refined sense of
discernment and appreciation for quality, style, and effectiveness. It
involves recognizing what elements contribute to a piece of work being
considered "good" within its specific domain. In writing, taste may
manifest as an appreciation for compelling narratives, eloquent prose,
and impactful storytelling. In programming, taste can be seen in clean,
efficient, and maintainable code that elegantly solves problems.</p>
<p>How do you recongize what's good?</p>
<p>Recognizing what's good is a skill developed through exposure, study,
and practice. As Cal Newport emphasizes, deliberate practice and deep
work are crucial in honing one's craft. By immersing yourself in the
works of master writers or programmers, you begin to internalize the
qualities that make their work exceptional. Over time, you develop an
intuitive sense of what constitutes good work in your field.</p>
<p>Rick Rubin often speaks about the importance of emotional resonance
in creative work. In writing, a good piece is one that evokes a strong
emotional response in the reader, whether it's through relatable
characters, powerful themes, or vivid imagery. In programming, a good
piece of code is one that not only functions correctly but also
communicates its intent clearly and is pleasurable to read and
maintain.</p>
