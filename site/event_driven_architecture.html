<h1>event_driven_architecture.htm</h1>
<p>An event-driven architecture uses events to trigger and communicate
between decoupled services and is common in modern applications built
with microservices.</p>
<p>An event is a change in state, or an update, like an item being
placed in a shopping cart on an e-commerce website. <strong>Events can
either carry the state (the item purchased, its price, and a delivery
address) or events can be identifiers</strong> (a notification that an
order was shipped).</p>
<p>Event-driven architectures have three key components: event
producers, event routers, and event consumers.</p>
<p>In Request/Response the API are the building blocks. In event-driven.
data is the building block.</p>
<p>It's powered by Apache Kafka.</p>
<p><strong>Why use it?</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Event persistence</li>
<li>Single point of failure</li>
<li>Performance</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When to use?</strong></p>
<p>![[Pasted image 20240618115255.png]]</p>
<h3>Components</h3>
<p>Pub/Sub Model</p>
<ul>
<li>Consumers (APIs)</li>
<li>Brokers
<ul>
<li>Manages who gets what message</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Producers
<ul>
<li>Produces the messages</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>Architecture Patterns</h3>
<p>The value of a pattern is telling you things to watch out for. Most
systems have some form of these patterns.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Event notification
<ul>
<li>A key element of event notification is that the source system
doesn't really care much about the response</li>
<li>An application creates an event, that goes into a queue</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Event-driven state transfer
<ol type="1">
<li>Since we have more availability we have less consistency
(eventual)</li>
<li>We try to keep the data consistent across all services</li>
</ol></li>
<li>Event sourcing
<ul>
<li>Upsides
<ul>
<li>Auditing, debugging, historic state, alternative state, memory
image</li>
<li>With more RAM we can do a lot more processes without using a
database</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Downsides
<ul>
<li>Unfamiliar, external systems, event schema, identifiers</li>
</ul></li>
<li>You have logs and application state</li>
<li>You could rebuild the application state based on the logs</li>
<li>Version control is a form of event sourcing system (builds app state
off log changes)</li>
<li>Another example is the accounting ledger</li>
</ul></li>
<li>CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
<ul>
<li>You have a write component and a read component</li>
<li>Similar pattern is used in other databases (oltp and olap)</li>
</ul></li>
</ol>
<h3>Design Patterns</h3>
<ul>
<li>Unit of Work</li>
<li>Dependency Inversion
<ul>
<li>All components (prod / consumer) depend on an abstraction (event
broker)</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3>Disadvantages</h3>
<ul>
<li>Keeping data consistent
<ul>
<li>EDA uses "eventual consistency"; it might cause problems if the data
is not aligned across all systems</li>
<li>We can use a cache layer to mitigate this (e.g., redis)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Duplicate messages
<ul>
<li>If the server goes offline and back online, it might get
duplicates</li>
<li>We can use unique IDs to not process the same events twice</li>
</ul></li>
<li>More complex
<ul>
<li>More components to build</li>
<li>Harder to debug when we have issues</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h2>Azure</h2>
<p><strong>Service Bus vs. Event Grid</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Azure Service Bus is an <strong>enterprise messaging
product</strong>. It covers queuing, pub/sub, and has multiple compute
based features. Receiving is done via polling (long polling) and
usually, a namespace is accessed within/by a single organization.</li>
<li>Azure Event Grid is a <strong>notification service</strong>. Its
sole purpose is to enable pub/sub between event generators and
subscribers. It has no queuing semantics. Message delivery is push-based
and only a few compute based features are available unlike with Service
Bus</li>
</ul>
<h3>Azure Service Bus</h3>
<ul>
<li>Fully managed message broker with message queues and pub-sub
topics.</li>
<li>Benefits:
<ul>
<li>Load-balancing</li>
<li>Routes data</li>
<li>Coordinates transactional work</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Concepts</strong></p>
<p><strong>Queues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Messages are sent to and received from <strong>queues</strong>.
Queues store messages until the receiving application is available to
receive and process them.</li>
<li>Service Bus keeps messages in memory or volatile storage until
client reports them as accepted.</li>
<li>Messages are delivered in <strong>pull</strong> mode, only
delivering messages when requested.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Topics</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>You can also use <strong>topics</strong> to send and receive
messages. While a queue is often used for point-to-point communication,
topics are useful in publish-subscribe scenarios.</li>
<li>Topics can have multiple subscribers</li>
<li>You can define rules on a subscription. A subscription can have a
filter to define a condition for the message. It also has an optional
action to modify the metadata</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Namespaces</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>A namespace is a container for all messaging components (queues and
topics). A namespace can have one or more queues and topics and it often
serves as an application container.</li>
</ul>
