<h2>Book Review: A Mind At Play, Claude Shannon</h2>
<p>Rating: 8/10</p>
<p>Overall, I've found this book extremely entertaining. The most
inspiring feature of Claude Shannon is his curiosity and his
modesty.</p>
<p>As a shy person, Claude Shannon's focus early on his career was to
understand mathematics and solve important problems with it. He took
Vannevar Bush as a mentor and learned from the people who came before
him to build the information theory.</p>
<p>Before he started working on information theory he worked on a
variety of areas including creating an "algebra of genetics", even
before we understood the origins of the DNA.</p>
<p>Once he created the information theory, he received praise from all
over the world. Receiving honorary doctorates and the Kyoto prize.
Throughout this time, he remained a modest person worrying about whether
people would still find him interesting afte repeating the same theories
time and time again.</p>
<p>He had a slew of trinkets and gadgets in his garage. His time at Bell
Labs and MIT afforded him the time to expand his thinking and not take
his work too seriously. He delved into the world of juggling, artificial
intelligence, and robotics.</p>
<p>He created a mouse that could exit mazes, a chess-playing machine,
and a clothe hanging robot that would rotate all of his doctorate
robes.</p>
<p>His most impressive feat is not being chained to his past
accomplishments. He focused on following his curiosity wherever life
would take him. He joined the juggling club at MIT and published one of
the first papers on the "Mathematics of Juggling". Once he got into AI
he predicted machines would one day mesh with humans and think and work
like us.</p>
<p>Claude Shannon is an inspiration for those seeking to work beyond
their career. To those seeking a role model for how to follow your
curiosity, think deeply, and be modest after you've been receiving
acclaim for your accomplishments. He is also an inspirational family
man, he would stay at home and spend a lot of time with his family.
Having his colleagues visit him whenever they'd want to discuss
ideas.</p>
<p>I found this biography to reassure the power of following your
curiosity every step along the way. Even as you get older to keep
learning, asking questions, and reading from different fields. Claude
Shannon's foundation in math allowed him to use that strong base of
knowledge to dissect and analyze other fields. It emphasizes the
importance of building a strong base of knowledge in your field and find
connections with others.</p>
