<h2>Notes on Meditations by Marcus Aurelius</h2>
<h3>Glossary</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Daimon</strong>: The daimon is then equivalent to the
Reason, to the self, to the intellect (nous), to the power of reflection
(dianoia), and to the guiding principle (hegemonikon). [<a

<li><strong>Ruling power</strong>: when Marcus Aurelius says "our ruling
power," he is referring to the human mind, and he is reminding us that
we have the power to choose how we live our lives</li>
</ul>
<h3>Book 3</h3>
<p>Marcus Aurelius starts with a reflection on the shortness of life and
the importance of a sense of urgency and a zest to cultivate knowledge
and live according to nature</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We ought to consider not only that our life is daily wasting away,
but also that if a man should live longer, it is quite uncertain whether
the understanding will still continue sufficient for the comprehension
of things</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>... we must make hast then, not only because we are daily near to
death, but also because the conception of things and the understanding
of them cease first</p>
</blockquote>
<p>He also encourages us to <em>observe that even the things which
follow after the things that are produced according to nature contain
something pleasing and attractive</em></p>
<p>In his life, he seemed to have to remind himself how if we appreciate
the nature in everything, we will see with no less pleasure the <em>real
gaping jaws of wild beasts</em> than those that painters and sculptors
show by imitation. We are able to look at the comeliness of old men and
to look at young beauty with chaste eyes.</p>
<p>He continued with emphasizing to not <em>waste the remainder of your
life in thoughts about others</em>. When we care too much about what a
person is doing, why, and what is he saying, and what he thinks of us,
we steer away from our ruling power.</p>
<p>Our activity should concentrate in our own lot, making your own
actions fair and being persuaded that your portion is good.</p>
<p>He recommends us to to be cheerful, and <em>"do not seek external
help or the tranquility others give. A man then must stand erect, not be
kept erected by others."</em></p>
<p>All that we have in this life is the present moment, an indivisible
point; the rest of our life is either past or uncertain.</p>
<p>Being in the present moment allows us to apply ourselves to the task
before us, following right reason seriously, vigorously, calmly, without
allowing anything to distract us.</p>
<p>We finish this book with a reminder to live in our own terms and come
to the end of life pure, tranquil, ready to depart, and without any
compulsion, perfectly reconciled with our lot.</p>
<h3>Book 4</h3>
<p>This book starts with a focus on maintaining our own inner
tranquility. Marcus Aurelius emphasizes that it doesn't matter where you
travel, no retreat is more pure than your own soul.</p>
<p>When we face difficulties, we must realize that enduring is part of
justice and that men do wrong involuntarily.</p>
<p>He emphasizes this with a beautiful quote:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Things do not touch the soul, for they are external and remain
immovable; so our perturbations come only from our own inner
opinions</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The other is that all things you see around will change immediately
and will no longer be; and constantly bear in mind how many of these
changes we have witnessed</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>The universe is transformation, life is opinion</p>
</blockquote>
