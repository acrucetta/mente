<h2>Notes on Happiness</h2>
<h3>From David Brooks</h3>
<ol type="1">
<li>Do not fall prey to seeking pure happiness. Instead, seek lifelong
progress toward happierness.</li>
<li>Manage as best you can the main sources of misery in your life by
attending to your physical and mental health, maintaining employment,
and ensuring an adequate income.</li>
<li>If you’re earning enough to take care of your principal needs,
remember that happiness at work comes not from chasing higher income but
from pursuing a sense of accomplishment and service to others.</li>
<li>Cultivate deep relationships through marriage, family, and real
friendships. Remember that happiness is love.</li>
<li>If you have discretionary income left over, use it to invest in your
relationships with family and friends.</li>
<li>Spend time in nature, surround yourself with beauty that uplifts
you, and consume the art and music that nourish your spirit.</li>
<li>Find a path of transcendence—one that explains the big picture in
life and helps you comprehend suffering and the purpose of your
existence.</li>
</ol>
