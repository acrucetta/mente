<h2>Notes on Careers</h2>
<h3>From the 40 year career (Irrational Excuberence blog)</h3>
<ul>
<li>Don't think of your career as stints from IPO to IPO</li>
<li>Focus on growth and engagement over time; measure your career in
decades</li>
<li>Focus on a small handfun of things that compound over time
<ul>
<li>Pace
<ul>
<li>Pace yourself, don't burn out</li>
<li>How long of a vacation does it take to not feel anxious about coming
back</li>
</ul></li>
<li>People
<ul>
<li>Are you building your network? If not work at a larger company for a
few years</li>
<li>They will be there for you throughout your life; become referrals,
new opportunities, etc...</li>
<li>Approach each new role with the intention of building a network of
folks you know and work with well</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Prestige
<ul>
<li>Prestige can be a lubricant</li>
<li>You can manufacture prestige by producing great work, blogging,
sharing your projects</li>
<li>Leverage your success in a role to a role thats a bit bigger</li>
<li>Deliberately sharing in your blog, writing for others, publishing
books</li>
<li>Prestige can be the result of deliberate, intentional action over
time</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Profit
<ul>
<li>The best roles can be only accessible if you're already financially
stable; that is you can interview, take your time talking with
companies</li>
<li>For some people it can take 10 months</li>
<li>The key is not getting rich but creating flexibility for
yourself</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Learning
<ul>
<li>Spend 4 hours a week thinking about the future, then let that
thinking compound over time</li>
<li>Each year set personal and professional goals; you can learn deep or
learn broad. You need ample space for both</li>
<li>Each year identify two new things that you're uncomfortable with and
do them</li>
<li>Do enough to maintain your habit of learninng</li>
<li>Learning doesn't only come from doing new things, it comes from
reflecting on the things you do. You need space to reflect</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
