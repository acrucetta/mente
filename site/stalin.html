<h2>Notes on Stalin's Biography</h2>
<h3>The desire to control</h3>
<p>I recently learned about Stalin, how he has continued to maneuver his
influence through military leaders and propaganda. And how they had to
balance their concessions to farmers with the New Economic Policy, and
their desires to have a socialist republic. It has been an interesting
tension between economic freedom to develop the country and the
socialist vision of having control. To unify the entire country under a
mantle of "equality." The curious thing has been that to reach this
mantle of equality, they had to make concessions to make the country
more capitalist.</p>
<p>Apparently, capital is needed to develop any number of projects. This
is the step that even Marx recognized. To have industry, capital is
needed. And capital generates the concentration of money around the
people who use it innovatively.</p>
<p>The other interesting part of the book is the state's desire to have
control, a "vision" over the entire Soviet Union. It is something that
has been difficult to control due to the different races and cultures
that its vast territory encompasses.</p>
<p>The other thing I have been learning about is from the book
<em>Laughter and Forgetfulness</em>. How in the dynamics of changing a
city, a culture, leaders can erase buildings, stories, diaries. It
reminds me of <em>1984</em> when the regime rebuilt history based on its
utopian vision of control over the population.</p>
<p>It is fascinating. The human desire to control vast territories based
on their utopian idea. Controlling ideas, controlling territory,
controlling thoughts, controlling history.</p>
