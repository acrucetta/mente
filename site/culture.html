<h2>Writing on Culture</h2>
<p><strong>Written by Dan Luu: https://danluu.com/culture/</strong>
- Culture is enforced by people
- Where you start working can influence what culture you bring to other places
- If you want to hire programmers that know how to program ask them programming questions 
- Growing up in a culture of excellence can translate across non-related domains (e.g., skiing to engineering)
- You can control behaviors by incentives, processes or culture
- It's easy to become a speaker at major conferences; you just need to submit a talk proposal; same applies with blogging
- Some skills are attitude dependent such as debugging
- Companies have a lot of problems worth more than your expected lifetime earnings; easy to knock several a year
- The culture can define whether people want to solve them or not
- Monetary rewards often contribute to solving them</p>
