<h2>Notes on Meaning</h2>
<p><strong>Written by John Gardner (The Road to
Self-Renewal)</strong></p>
<p>The world loves talent but pays off on character.</p>
<p>People of every age need commitments beyond the self, need the
meaning that commitments provide. Self-preoccupation is a prison, as
every self-absorbed person finally knows. Commitments beyond the self
can get you out of prison.</p>
<p>For many, this life is a vale of tears; for no one is it free of
pain. But we are so designed that we can cope with it if we can live in
some context of a coherent community and traditionally prescribed
patterns of culture. Today you can’t count on any such heritage. You
have to build meaning into your life, and you build it through your
commitments, whether to your religion, to an ethical order as you
conceive it, to your life’s work, to loved ones, to your fellow humans.
Young people run around searching for identity, but it isn’t handed out
free anymore - not in this transient, rootless, pluralistic society.
Your identity is what you’ve committed yourself to.</p>
<p>Meaning is not something you stumble across, like the answer to a
riddle or the prize in a treasure hunt. Meaning is something you build
into your life. You build it out of your own past, out of your
affections and loyalties, out of the experience of humankind as it is
passed on to you, out of your own talent and understanding, out of the
things you believe in, out of the things and people you love, out of the
values for which you are willing to sacrifice something. The ingredients
are there. You are the only one who can put them together into that
unique pattern that will be your life. Let it be a life that has dignity
and meaning for you. If it does, then the particular balance of success
or failure is of less account.</p>
