<h1>Who Cooks by Anthony Bourdain</h1>
<p>He greatly prefers Ecuadorians, as many chefs do: 'The Italian guy?
You screaming at him in the rush, "Where's that risotto?! Is that
fucking risotto ready yet? Gimme that risotto!" . . . and the Italian .
. . he's gonna give it to you . . . An Ecuadorian guy? He's gonna just
turn his back . . . and stir the risotto and keep cooking it until it's
done the way you showed him. That's what I want.'</p>
<p>American cooks-meaning, born in the USA, possibly school-trained,
culinarily sophisticated types who know before you show them what monter
au beurre means and how to make a béarnaise sauce-are a lazy,
undisciplined and, worst of all, high-maintenance lot, annoyingly
opinionated, possessed of egos requiring constant stroking and tune-ups,
and, as members of a privileged and wealthy population, unused to the
kind of 'disrespect' a busy chef is inclined to dish out.</p>
<p>The Ecuadorian, Mexican, Dominican and Salvadorian cooks I've worked
with over the years make most CIA-educated white boys look like clumsy,
sniveling little punks.</p>
<p>A guy who's come up through the ranks, who knows every station, every
recipe, every corner of the restaurant and who has learned, first and
foremost, your system above all others is likely to be more valuable and
long-term than some bed-wetting white boy whose mom brought him up
thinking the world owed him a living, and who thinks he actually knows a
few things.</p>
<p>If you let your mise-en-place run down, get dirty and disorganized,
you'll quickly find yourself spinning in place and calling for back-up.
I worked with a chef who used to step behind the line to a dirty cook's
station in the middle of the rush to explain why the offending cook was
falling behind. He'd press his palm down on the cutting board, which was
littered with peppercorns, spattered sauce, bits of parsley, breadcrumbs
and the usual flotsam and jetsam that accumulates quickly on a station
if not constantly wiped away with a moist side-towel. 'You see this?'
he'd inquire, raising his palm so that the cook could see the bits of
dirt and scraps sticking to his chef's palm, 'That's what the inside of
your head looks like now. Work clean!'</p>
<p>Being set up properly, trained and coordinated is not nearly enough.
A good line cook has to be able to remain clear-headed, organized and
reasonably even-keeled during hectic and stressful service periods.</p>
<p>Your hero line cook doesn't let the screaming, the frantic cries of
'Is it ready yet?', the long and potentially confusing list of
donenesses all working at the same time throw him. He's got to keep all
those temperatures straight in his head, remembering which steak goes
with what. He's got to be able to tune out the howls of outrage from the
chef, the tiny, gibbering annoyances from the floor, the curses and
questions and prompts from his co-workers: 'Ready on seven? Via! Let's
go! Vamos! Coming up on seven!</p>
<p>That's what counts. I can break down line cooks into three
subgroups.</p>
<p>You've got your Artists: the annoying, high-maintenance minority.
This group includes specialists like pâtissiers (the neurologists of
cooking), sous-chefs, butchers, garde-manger psychos, the occasional
saucier whose sauces are so ethereal and perfect that delusions of
grandeur are tolerated.</p>
<p>Then there are the Exiles: people who just can't make it any other
business, could never survive a nine-to-five job, wear a tie or blend in
with civilized society-and their comrades, the Refugees, usually emigres
and immigrants for whom cooking is preferable to death squads, poverty
or working in a sneaker factory for 2 dollars a week.</p>
<p>Finally, there are the Mercenaries: people who do it for cash and do
it well. Cooks who, though they have little love or natural proclivity
for cuisine, do it at a high level because they are paid well to do
it-and because they are professionals. Cooking is a craft, I like to
think, and a good cook is a craftsman-not an artist.</p>
