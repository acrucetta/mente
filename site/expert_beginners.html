<h2>What is an Expert Beginner</h2>
<p>A Competent has too much of a handle on the big picture to confuse
himself with an Expert: he knows what he doesn’t know. This isn’t true
during the Advanced Beginner phase, since Advanced Beginners are on the
“unskilled” end of the Dunning Kruger Effect and tend to epitomize the
notion that, “if I don’t understand it, it must be easy.”</p>
<p>As such, Advanced Beginners can break one of two ways: they can move
to Competent and start to grasp the big picture and their place in it,
or they can ‘graduate’ to Expert Beginner by assuming that they’ve
graduated to Expert.</p>
<p>If you’ve ever heard the aphorism about “ten years of experience or
the same year of experience ten times,” the Expert Beginner is the
epitome of the latter. The Expert Beginner has perfected the craft of
bowling a 160 out of 300 possible points by doing exactly the same thing
week in and week out.</p>
<p>Software is, unsurprisingly, not like bowling. In bowling, feedback
cycles are on the order of minutes, whereas in software, feedback cycles
tend to be on the order of months, if not years. And what I’m talking
about with software is not the feedback cycle of compile or run or unit
tests, which is minutes or seconds, but rather the project.</p>
<p>It’s during the full lifetime of a project that a developer gains
experience writing code, source controlling it, modifying it, testing
it, and living with previous design and architecture decisions during
maintenance phases. With everything I’ve just described, a developer is
lucky to have a first try of less than six months, which means that,
after five years in the industry, maybe they have ten cracks at
application development. (This is on average–some will be stuck on a
single one this whole time while others will have dozens.)Software is,

<h2>How to Avoid Being One</h2>
<p>First of all, to prevent yourself from falling into the Expect
Beginner trap, the most important thing to do is not to believe your own
hype. Take pride in your own accomplishments as appropriate, but never
consider your education complete or your opinion above questioning
regardless of your title, your years of experience, your awards and
accomplishments, or anything else that isn’t rational argumentation or
evidence. Retaining a healthy degree of humility, constantly striving
for improvement, and valuing objective metrics above subjective
considerations will go a long way to preventing yourself from becoming
an Expert Beginner.</p>
<p>In terms of preventing this phenomenon from corrupting a software
group, here is a list of things that can help:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Give team members as much creative freedom as possible to let them
showcase their approaches (and remember that you learn more from
failures than successes).</li>
<li>Provide incentives or rewards for learning a new language, approach,
framework, pattern, style, etc.</li>
<li>Avoid ever using number of years in the field or with the company as
a justification for favoring or accepting anyone’s argument as
superior.</li>
<li>Put policies in place that force external perspectives into the
company (lunch-and-learns, monthly training, independent audits,
etc).</li>
<li>Whenever possible, resolve disputes/disagreements with objective
measures rather than subjective considerations like seniority or
democratic vote.</li>
<li>Create a “culture of proof”–opinions don’t matter unless they’re
supported with independent accounts, statistics, facts, etc.</li>
<li>Do a periodic poll of employees, junior and senior, and ask them to
list a few of their strengths and an equal number of things they know
nothing about or would like to know more about. This is to deflate ahead
of time an air of “know-it-all-ism” around anyone–especially tenured
team members.</li>
