<h2>Notes on Data Observability</h2>
<h3>Source: Metaplane</h3>
<p>❝Data observability is the degree of visibility you have into your
data at any point in time."</p>
<p>Common data issues, such as data inconsistency, outdated or incorrect
data, and data silos, can be addressed with data observability.
Additionally, data observability can help businesses make more informed
decisions by providing a clear picture of the context and quality of
their data.</p>
<p>Data teams with data observability tools leverage their historical
metadata to complete the following mission-critical jobs:</p>
<ul>
<li>Continuous data monitoring: Is the state of our data sufficient to
meet the needs of external use cases and internal standards?</li>
<li>Data incident management: when a data issue occurs, how do we keep
track of the state of this issue, assign owners, and measure the quality
and accuracy of our data over time?</li>
<li>Root cause analysis: When a data quality issue occurs, what upstream
dependencies caused it to happen (and how fast can the problem be
resolved)?</li>
<li>Impact analysis: What are the downstream consequences of a data
quality issue, when one does occur? Which downstream teams, like a data
analytics team or data scientists, should be notified?</li>
<li>Spend monitoring: How much money are we using for compute resources,
and how is it allocated across our data stack?</li>
<li>Usage analytics: By whom, when, how much, and in what manner are our
data assets being used by stakeholders?</li>
<li>Query profiling: How can I optimize both my data assets and
stakeholder queries to minimize time and cost?</li>
</ul>
