<h2>Notes on how to figure out what to read</h2>
<h3>What and how to read from Financial Times</h3>
<ul>
<li>Avoid the contemporary. If a novel has worth, it will still have in
a decade or two. "The filtering effect of time — imperfect in its
judgment, but still the best thing we have — will remove some books from
consideration"</li>
<li>In nonfiction, if the content is topical, e.g., US China Relations
it will age at speed. Best to use journalism or ChatGPT.</li>
<li>As Schopenhauer said, avoid what's making a great commotion. To read
well is to ignore the now. The opportunity cost is way too high.</li>
<li>Don't read fewer than 50 pages in a sitting. The cost of pecking at
a book here and there is a lost sense of its narrative.</li>
<li>Avoid general histories. The last way to learn about China is a book
named China. THe universal is in the particular.</li>
<li>As the highest rule, priviledge the old.</li>
</ul>
