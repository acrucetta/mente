<h2 id="notes-from-walter-isaacsons-biography-on-elon-musk">Notes from
Walter Isaacson’s Biography on Elon Musk</h2>
<p>I’ve thoroughly enjoyed this book, to me there are many things to
learn from Elon Musk. Both things to do more of and things to avoid.</p>
<p>At a high level; I admired his sense of mission, his urgency to solve
problems, and his focus on challenging rules. All of his companies stem
from a deep passion to go to Mars.</p>
<p>At an engineering level; I think it’s worth diving deeper into his
algorithm:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><strong>Question every requirement</strong>. Each should come with
the name of the person who made it. You should never accept that a
requirement came from a department, such as from “the legal department”
or “the safety department.” You need to know the name of the real person
who made that requirement. Then you should question it, no matter how
smart that person is. Requirements from smart people are the most
dangerous, because people are less likely to question them. Always do
so, even if the requirement came from me. Then make the requirements
less dumb.</li>
<li><strong>Delete any part or process you can</strong>. You may have to
add them back later. In fact, if you do not end up adding back at least
10% of them, then you didn’t delete enough.</li>
<li><strong>Simplify and optimize.</strong> This should come after step
two. common mistake is to simplify and optimize a part or a process that
should not exist.</li>
<li><strong>Accelerate cycle time.</strong> Every process can be speeded
up. But only do this after you have followed the first three steps. In
the Tesla factory, I mistakenly spent a lot of time accelerating
processes that I later realized should have been deleted.</li>
<li><strong>Automate</strong>. That comes last. The big mistake in
Nevada and at Fremont was that I began by trying to automate every step.
We should have waited until all the requirements had been questioned,
parts and processes deleted, and the bugs were shaken out.</li>
</ol>
<p>Additional rules he has applied in his career: - Skip-level meetings,
don’t meet with you direct reports, meet with one level below - Managers
should be technical, they should spend 20% of their time doing
engineering work - Go direct to the source for information - Every
process should have a person responsible for it</p>
