<h2>Notes on Work</h2>
<h3>Paul Graham (How to Do Great Work)</h3>
<p>Formulas for meaningful work:</p>
<ul>
<li>Reading + People + Writing = New Ideas</li>
<li>Trying + Time = Interests (Multiplier if you're younger)</li>
<li>Interest + Hard Work + Luck = Results</li>
</ul>
<p>Main Ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>The way to figure out what to work on is by working. It's okay to
guess wrong. In fact, it's better to know multiple things and make
connections</li>
<li>To know what to work on, you need to ask yourself what are you
curious to a degree that would bore most other people
<ul>
<li>Once you find that thing, learn enough to get to the <em>frontiers
of knowledge</em></li>
<li>These frontiers of knowledge look abstract from afar; but once you
learn enough about a subject you'll find many gaps in research; areas
ripe for you to explore</li>
<li>The four steps are: choose a field, learn enough to get to the
frontier, notice gaps, explore promising ones</li>
<li>Interest will drive you to do something impressive</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Ambition can come before you learn something, or can come as you
learn more about it</li>
<li>If you don't know what to work on; take chance meetings, make
yourself a big target for luck. Try lots of things, meet people, read
books, ask questions</li>
<li>A field should become increasingly interesting to you as you learn
more about it
<ul>
<li>If you like areas that are deemed as tedious then its a good
sign</li>
</ul></li>
<li>When working, you should do the things you'd want to consume, read,
or use; don't write for a seemingly abstract audience</li>
<li>Beware of pretentiousness, fashion, fear, money, politices, other
people's wishes, and eminent frauds. Stick to what <em>you</em> find
interesting</li>
<li>The key recipe is: work hard on excitingly ambitious projects and
something good will come out of it
<ul>
<li>Don't plan too much; naiveté can be good, specially when you're
younger</li>
<li>At each stage, do whatever seems more interesting and gives you
options for the future</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Try to arrange your life so that you have contiguous blocks of time
to work in; otherwise you can shy away from hard tasks</li>
<li>Work has some activation energy; when you want to get started, do
the least amount of work possible and let the compounding energy drive
you. Its okay to lie to get you going</li>
<li><strong>Try to finish what you start</strong> ; even if it turns out
to be more work than expected. The last bits of a project can include
the best work</li>
<li>Ask yourself: am I working on what I most want to work on? Ok if not
when young, dangerous when older</li>
<li>Great work happens by focusing consistently on something you're
interested in
<ul>
<li>It compounds over time</li>
<li>You can learn more easily as you learn more about a subject</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Cultivate your taste in work done in your field.
<ul>
<li>What makes great work? What makes it so?</li>
<li><strong>This is what you're aiming for</strong></li>
</ul></li>
<li><strong>If you don't try to be the best, you won't even be
good</strong>
<ul>
<li>Errors in ambition happen in one direction - miss by falling
short</li>
<li>Being "good" can be too vague of a standard</li>
<li>It can be easier to be the best than only to be good</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Aim to do something people will care about in 100 years
<ul>
<li>If something still seems good it's worth doing</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Be earnest; avoid affectation
<ul>
<li>Affectation = pretending someone other than you is doing the work;
adopting a fake persona</li>
<li>Earnestness = being intellectually honest, have a sharp eye for the
truth; admit when you make a mistake</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Preserve the nerd
<ul>
<li>Keep the innocent boldness from childhood</li>
<li>Put things out there instead of criticizing others</li>
<li>Be informal, spend little effort seeming anything other than what
you are. Basically a nerd.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Originality isn't a process, but a habit of mind
<ul>
<li>Original ideas come from trying to build or understand something
slightly too difficult</li>
<li>Writing about ideas helps you create a sort of vacuum that drives
more ideas out of you</li>
<li>Changing your context can help; visiting new places or going for a
walk</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Don't divide your attention too thinly; be professionally curious
about a few topics and idly curious about many more</li>
</ul>
